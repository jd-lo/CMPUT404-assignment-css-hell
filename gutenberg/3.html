    <h2>PREFACE.</h2>
    <p>
      In these few pages I have tried to prepare something about camping and
      walking, such as I should have enjoyed reading when I was a boy; and, with
      this thought in my mind, I some years ago began to collect the
      subject-matter for a book of this kind, by jotting down all questions
      about camping, &amp;c., that my young friends asked me. I have also taken
      pains, when I have been off on a walk, or have been camping, to notice the
      parties of campers and trampers that I have chanced to meet, and have made
      a note of their failures or success. The experiences of the pleasant days
      when, in my teens, I climbed the mountains of Oxford County, or sailed
      through Casco Bay, have added largely to the stock of notes; and finally
      the diaries of "the war," and the recollections of "the field," have
      contributed generously; so that, with quotations, and some help from other
      sources, a sizable volume is ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it is prepared for young men,—for students more especially,—it
      contains much, I trust, that will prove valuable to campers-out in
      general.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      I am under obligations to Dr. Elliott Coues, of the United States Army,
      for the valuable advice contained in Chapter XIII.; and I esteem it a
      piece of good fortune that his excellent work ("Field Ornithology") should
      have been published before this effort of mine, for I hardly know where
      else I could have found the information with authority so unquestionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prof. Edward S. Morse has increased the debt of gratitude I already owe
      him, by taking his precious time to draw my illustrations, and prepare
      them for the engraver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. J. Edward Fickett of Portland, a sailmaker, and formerly of the navy,
      has assisted in the chapter upon tents; and there are numbers of my young
      friends who will recognize the results of their experience, as they read
      these pages, and will please to receive my thanks for making them known to
      me.

    <h2>HOW TO CAMP OUT.</h2>
    <hr style="width: 65%" />
    <h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
    <h3>GETTING READY.</h3>
    <p>
      The hope of camping out that comes over one in early spring, the laying of
      plans and arranging of details, is, I sometimes think, even more enjoyable
      than reality itself. As there is pleasure in this, let me advise you to
      give a practical turn to your anticipations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think over and decide whether you will walk, go horseback, sail, camp out
      in one place, or what you will do; then learn what you can of the route
      you propose to go over, or the ground where you intend to camp for the
      season. If you think of moving through or camping in places unknown to
      you, it is important to learn whether you can buy provisions and get
      lodgings along your route. See some one, if you can, who has been where
      you think of going,
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span
      >and put down in a note-book all he tells you that is important.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have your clothes made or mended as soon as you decide what you will need:
      the earlier you begin, the less you will be hurried at the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will find it is a good plan, as fast as you think of a thing that you
      want to take, to note it on your memorandum; and, in order to avoid delay
      or haste, to cast your eyes over the list occasionally to see that the
      work of preparation is going on properly. It is a good plan to collect all
      of your baggage into one place as fast as it is ready; for if it is
      scattered you are apt to lose sight of some of it, and start without it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As fast as you get your things ready, mark your name on them: mark every
      thing. You can easily cut a stencil-plate out of an old postal card, and
      mark with a common shoe-blacking brush such articles as tents, poles,
      boxes, firkins, barrels, coverings, and bags.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some railroads will not check barrels, bags, or bundles, nor take them on
      passenger trains. Inquire beforehand, and send your baggage ahead if the
      road will not take it on your train.
    </p>
    <p>
      Estimate the expenses of your trip, and take more money than your
      estimate. Carry also an abundance of small change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not be in a hurry to spend money on new
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span
      >inventions. Every year there is put upon the market some patent knapsack,
      folding stove, cooking-utensil, or camp trunk and cot combined; and there
      are always for sale patent knives, forks, and spoons all in one,
      drinking-cups, folding portfolios, and marvels of tools. Let them all
      alone: carry your pocket-knife, and if you can take more let it be a
      sheath or butcher knife and a common case-knife.
    </p>
    <p>Take iron or cheap metal spoons.</p>
    <p>Do not attempt to carry crockery or glassware upon a march.</p>
    <p>
      A common tin cup is as good as any thing you can take to drink from; and
      you will find it best to carry it so that it can be used easily.<a
        id="FNanchor_1_1"
      ></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1_1">[1]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Take nothing nice into camp, expecting to keep it so: it is almost
      impossible to keep things out of the dirt, dew, rain, dust, or sweat, and
      from being broken or bruised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many young men, before starting on their summer vacation, think that the
      barber must give their hair a "fighting-cut;" but it is not best to shave
      the head so closely, as it is then too much exposed to the sun, flies, and
      mosquitoes. A moderately short cut to the hair, however, is advisable for
      comfort and cleanliness.
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are going to travel where you have never been before, begin early
      to study your map. It is of great importance, you will find, to learn all
      you can of the neighborhood where you are going, and to fix it in your
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      So many things must be done at the last moment, that it is best to do what
      you can beforehand; but try to do nothing that may have to be undone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wear what you please if it be comfortable and durable: do not mind what
      people say. When you are camping you have a right to be independent.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are going on a walking-party, one of the best things you can do is
      to "train" a week or more before starting, by taking long walks in the
      open air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, leave your business in such shape that it will not call you back;
      and do not carry off keys, &amp;c., which others must have; nor neglect to
      see the dentist about the tooth that
      <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'usuually'">usually</ins>
      aches when you most want it to keep quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      For convenience the following list is inserted here. It is condensed from
      a number of notes made for trips of all sorts, except boating and
      horseback-riding. It is by no means exhaustive, yet there are very many
      more things named than you can possibly use to advantage upon any one
      tour. Be careful not to be led astray by it into
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span
      >overloading yourself, or filling your camp with useless luggage. Be sure
      to remember this.

    <h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
    <h3>SMALL PARTIES TRAVELLING AFOOT AND CAMPING.</h3>
    <p>
      We will consider separately the many ways in which a party can spend a
      summer vacation; and first we will start into wild and uninhabited
      regions, afoot, carrying on our backs blankets, a tent, frying-pan, food,
      and even a shot-gun and fishing-tackle. This is <i>very</i> hard work for
      a young man to follow daily for any length of time; and, although it
      sounds romantic, yet let no party of young people think they can find
      pleasure in it many days; for if they meet with a reverse, have much rainy
      weather, or lose their way, some one will almost surely be taken sick, and
      all sport will end.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a mountain to climb, or a short trip of only a day or two, I
      would not discourage you from going in this way; but for any extended tour
      it is too severe a strain upon the physical powers of one not accustomed
      to similar hard work.<span class="pagenum"
        ><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span
      >
    </p>
    <h3>AFOOT.—CAMPING OUT.</h3>
    <p>
      A second and more rational way, especially for small parties, is that of
      travelling afoot in the roads of a settled country, carrying a blanket,
      tent, food, and cooking-utensils; cooking your meals, and doing all the
      work yourselves. If you do not care to travel fast, to go far, or to spend
      much money, this is a fine way. But let me caution you first of all about
      overloading, for this is the most natural thing to do. It is the tendency
      of human nature to accumulate, and you will continually pick up things on
      your route that you will wish to take along; and it will require your best
      judgment to start with the least amount of luggage, and to keep from
      adding to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have probably read that a soldier carries a musket, cartridges,
      blanket, overcoat, rations, and other things, weighing forty or fifty
      pounds. You will therefore say to yourself, "I can carry twenty." Take
      twenty pounds, then, and carry it around for an hour, and see how you like
      it. Very few young men who read this book will find it possible to
      <i>enjoy</i> themselves, and carry more than twenty pounds a greater
      distance than ten miles a day, for a week. To carry even the twenty pounds
      ten miles a day is hard work to many, although every summer there are
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span
      >parties who do their fifteen, twenty, and more miles daily, with big
      knapsacks on their backs; but it is neither wise, pleasant, nor healthful,
      to the average young man, to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us cut down our burden to the minimum, and see how much it will be.
      First of all, you must take a rubber blanket or a light rubber
      coat,—something that will surely shed water, and keep out the dampness of
      the earth when slept on. You must have something of this sort, whether
      afoot, horseback, with a wagon, or in permanent camp.<a

    <p>
      For carrying your baggage you will perhaps prefer a knapsack, though many
      old soldiers are not partial to that article. There are also for sale
      broad straps and other devices as substitutes for the knapsack. Whatever
      you take, be sure it has broad straps to go over your shoulders: otherwise
      you will be constantly annoyed from their cutting and chafing you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can dispense with the knapsack altogether in the same way that
      soldiers do,—by rolling up in your blanket whatever you have to
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span
      >carry. You will need to take some pains in this, and perhaps call a
      comrade to assist you. Lay out the blanket flat, and roll it as tightly as
      possible without folding it, enclosing the other baggage<a
        id="FNanchor_3_3"
      ></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_3_3">[3]</a> as you roll;
      then tie it in a number of places to prevent unrolling, and the shifting
      about of things inside; and finally tie or strap together the two ends,
      and throw the ring thus made over the shoulder, and wear it as you do the
      strap of the haversack,—diagonally across the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advantages of the roll over the knapsack are important. You save the
      two and a half pounds weight; the roll is very much easier to the
      shoulder, and is easier shifted from one shoulder to the other, or taken
      off; and you can ease the
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span
      >burden a little with your hands. It feels bulky at first, but you soon
      become used to it. On the whole, you will probably prefer the roll to the
      knapsack; but if you carry much weight you will very soon condemn whatever
      way you carry it, and wish for a change.
    </p>
    <p>
      A haversack is almost indispensable in all pedestrian tours. Even if you
      have your baggage in a wagon, it is best to wear one, or some sort of a
      small bag furnished with shoulder straps, so that you can carry a lunch,
      writing materials, guide-book, and such other small articles as you
      constantly need. You can buy a haversack at the stores where sportsmen's
      outfits are sold; or you can make one of enamel-cloth or rubber drilling,
      say eleven inches deep by nine wide, with a strap of the same material
      neatly doubled and sewed together, forty to forty-five inches long, and
      one and three-quarters inches wide. Cut the back piece about nineteen
      inches long, so as to allow for a flap eight inches long to fold over the
      top and down the front. Sew the strap on the upper corners of the back
      piece, having first sewed a facing inside, to prevent its tearing out the
      back.
    </p>
    <h3>WOOLLEN BLANKET.</h3>
    <p>
      Next in the order of necessities is a woollen blanket,—a good stout one,
      rather than the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span
      >light or flimsy one that you may think of taking. In almost all of the
      Northern States the summer nights are apt to be chilly; while in the
      mountainous regions, and at the seaside, they are often fairly cold. A
      lining of cotton drilling will perhaps make a thin blanket serviceable.
      This lining does not need to be quite as long nor as wide as the blanket,
      since the ends and edges of the blanket are used to tuck under the
      sleeper. One side of the lining should be sewed to the blanket, and the
      other side and the ends buttoned; or you may leave off the end buttons.
      You can thus dry it, when wet, better than if it were sewed all around.
      You can lay what spare clothing you have, and your day-clothes, between
      the lining and blanket, when the night is very cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      In almost any event, you will want to carry a spare shirt; and in cold
      weather you can put this on, when you will find that a pound of shirt is
      as warm as two pounds of overcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you take all I advise, you will not absolutely need an overcoat, and
      can thus save carrying a number of pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tent question we will discuss elsewhere; but you can hardly do with
      less than a piece of shelter-tent. If you have a larger kind, the man who
      carries it must have some one to assist him in carrying his own stuff, so
      that the burden may be equalized.<span class="pagenum"
        ><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      If you take tent-poles, they will vex you sorely, and tempt you to throw
      them away: if you do not carry them, you will wonder when night comes why
      you did not take them. If your tent is not large, so that you can use
      light ash poles, I would at least start with them, unless the tent is a
      "shelter," as poles for this can be easily cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will have to carry a hatchet; and the kind known as the axe-pattern
      hatchet is better than the shingling-hatchet for driving tent-pins. I may
      as well caution you here not to try to drive tent-pins with the flat side
      of the axe or hatchet, for it generally ends in breaking the handle,—quite
      an accident when away from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      For cooking-utensils on a trip like that we are now proposing, you will do
      well to content yourself with a frying-pan, coffee-pot, and perhaps a tin
      pail; you can do wonders at cooking with these.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will consider the matter of cooking and food elsewhere; but the main
      thing now is to know beforehand where you are going, and to learn if there
      are houses and shops on the route. Of course you must have food; but, if
      you have to carry three or four days' rations in your haversack, I fear
      that many of my young friends will fail to see the pleasure of their trip.
      Yet carry <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span
      >them if you must: do not risk starvation, whatever you do. Also remember
      to always have something in your haversack, no matter how easy it is to
      buy what you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have now enumerated the principal articles of weight that a party must
      take on a walking-tour when they camp out, and cook as they go. If the
      trip is made early or late in the season, you must take more clothing. If
      you are gunning, your gun, &amp;c., add still more weight. Every one will
      carry towel, soap, comb, and toothbrush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there is a match-safe (which should be air-tight, or the matches will
      soon spoil), a box of salve, the knives, fork, spoon, dipper, portfolio,
      paper, Testament, &amp;c. Every man also has something in particular that
      "he wouldn't be without for any thing."<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_4_4">[4]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There should also be in every party a clothes brush, mosquito-netting,
      strings, compass, song-book, guide-book, and maps, which should be company
      property.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have supposed every one to be dressed about as usual, and have made
      allowance only for extra weight; viz.,—<span class="pagenum"

      You may be able to reduce the weight here given by taking a lighter
      blanket, and no knapsack or canteen; but most likely the food that you
      actually put in your haversack will weigh more than three pounds. You must
      also carry your share of the following things:—
    </p>
    <div class="center">
      <table
        style="border-spacing: 0px; padding: 2px; border-width: 0px"

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p>
      Then if you carry a heavier kind of tent than the "shelter," or carry
      tent-poles, you must add still more. Allow also nearly three pounds a day
      per man for food, if you carry more than enough for one day; and remember,
      that when tents, blankets, and clothes get wet, it adds about a quarter to
      their weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see, therefore, that you have the prospect of hard work. I do not wish
      to discourage you from going in this way: on the contrary, there is a
      great deal of pleasure to be had by doing so. But the majority of men
      under twenty years of
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span
      >age will find no pleasure in carrying so much weight more than ten miles
      a day; and if a party of them succeed in doing so, and in attending to all
      of the necessary work, without being worse for it, they will be fortunate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, then, if you walk, and carry all your stuff, camping, and
      doing all your work, and cooking as you go, you should travel but few
      miles a day, or, better still, should have many days when you do not move
      your camp at all.
    </p>
    <h3>OTHER WAYS OF GOING AFOOT.</h3>
    <p>
      It is not necessary to say much about the other ways of going afoot. If
      you can safely dispense with cooking and carrying food, much will be
      gained for travel and observation. The expenses, however, will be largely
      increased. If you can also dispense with camping, you ought then to be
      able to walk fifteen or twenty miles daily, and do a good deal of
      sight-seeing besides. You should be in practice, however, to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must know beforehand about your route, and whether the country is
      settled where you are going.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep in mind, when you are making plans, that it is easier for one or two
      to get accommodation at the farmhouses than for a larger party.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard once of two fellows, who, to avoid buying and carrying a tent,
      slept on hay-mows, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span
      >usually without permission. It looks to me as if those young men were
      candidates for the penitentiary. If you cannot travel honorably, and
      without begging, I should advise you to stay at home.<span class="pagenum"

    <hr style="width: 65%" />
    <h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
    <h3>LARGE PARTY TRAVELLING AFOOT WITH BAGGAGE-WAGON.</h3>
    <p>
      With a horse and wagon to haul your baggage you can of course carry more.
      First of all take another blanket or two, a light overcoat, more spare
      clothing, an axe, and try to have a larger tent than the "shelter."
    </p>
    <p>
      If the body of the wagon has high sides, it will not be a very difficult
      task to make a cloth cover that will shed water, and you will then have
      what is almost as good as a tent: you can also put things under the wagon.
      You must have a cover of some sort for your wagon-load while on the march,
      to prevent injury from showers that overtake you, and to keep out dust and
      mud. A tent-fly will answer for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      You want also to carry a few carriage-bolts, some nails, tacks, straps, a
      hand-saw, and axle-wrench or monkey-wrench. I have always found use for a
      sail-needle and twine; and I carry them
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span
      >now, even when I go for a few days, and carry all on my person.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first drawback that appears, when you begin to plan for a horse and
      wagon, is the expense. You can overcome this in part by adding members to
      your company; but then you meet what is perhaps a still more serious
      difficulty,—the management of a large party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another inconvenience of large numbers is that each member must limit his
      baggage. You are apt to accumulate too great bulk for the wagon, rather
      than too great weight for the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where there are many there must be a captain,—some one that the others are
      responsible to, and who commands their respect. It is necessary that those
      who join such a party should understand that they ought to yield to him,
      whether they like it or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain should always consult the wishes of the others, and should
      never let selfish considerations influence him. Every day his decisions as
      to what the party shall do will tend to make some one dissatisfied; and
      although it is the duty of the dissatisfied ones to yield, yet, since
      submission to another's will is so hard, the captain must try to prevent
      any "feeling," and above all to avoid even the appearance of tyranny.
    </p>
    <p>
      System and order become quite essential as our numbers increase, and it is
      well to have the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span
      >members take daily turns at the several duties; and during that day the
      captain must hold each man to a strict performance of his special trust,
      and allow no shirking.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few days some of the party will show a willingness to accept
      particular burdens all of the time; and, if these burdens are the more
      disagreeable ones, the captain will do well to make the detail permanent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing tends to make ill feeling more than having to do another's work;
      and, where there are many in a party, each one is apt to leave something
      for others to do. The captain must be on the watch for these things, and
      try to prevent them. It is well for him, and for all, to know that he who
      has been a "good fellow" and genial companion at home may prove quite
      otherwise during a tour of camping. Besides this, it is hardly possible
      for a dozen young men to be gone a fortnight on a trip of this kind
      without some quarrelling; and, as this mars the sport so much, all should
      be careful not to give or take offence. If you are starting out on your
      first tour, keep this fact constantly in mind.
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps I can illustrate this division of labor.</p>
    <p>
      We will suppose a party of twelve with one horse and an open wagon, four
      tents, a stove, and other baggage. First, number the party, and assign to
      each the duties for the first day.<span class="pagenum"

      The party is thus arranged in four squads of three men each, the oldest at
      the heads. One half of the party is actively engaged for to-day, while the
      other half has little to do of a general nature, except that all must take
      turns in leading the horse, and marching behind the wagon. It is essential
      that this be done, and it is best that only the stronger members lead the
      horse.

      the first six have their semi-holiday.

    <p>
      In a few days each man will have shown a special willingness for some
      duty, which by common consent and the captain's approval he is
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span
      >permitted to take. The party then is re-organized as follows:—

    <p>
      The daily detail for leading the horse will have to be made, as before,
      from the stronger members of the party; and if any special duty arises it
      must still be done by volunteering, or by the captain's suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this arrangement there is nothing to prevent one member from aiding
      another; in fact, where all are employed, a better feeling prevails, and,
      the work being done more quickly, there is more time for rest and
      enjoyment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      To get a horse will perhaps tax your judgment and capability as much as
      any thing in all your preparation; and on this point, where you need so
      much good advice, I can only give you that of a general nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time for camping out is when horses are in greatest demand for farming
      purposes; and you will find it difficult to hire of any one except
      livery-stable men, whose charges are so high that you cannot afford to
      deal with them. You will have to hunt a long time, and in many places,
      before you will find your animal. It is not prudent to take a valuable
      horse, and I advise you not to do so unless the owner or a man
      <i>thoroughly</i> acquainted with horses is in the party. You may perhaps
      be able to hire horse, wagon, and driver; but a hired man is an
      objectionable feature, for, besides the expense, such a man is usually
      disagreeable company.
    </p>
    <p>
      My own experience is, that it is cheaper to buy a horse outright, and to
      hire a harness and wagon; and, since I am not a judge of horse-flesh, I
      get some friend who is, to go with me and advise. I find that I can almost
      always buy a horse, even when I cannot hire. Twenty to fifty dollars will
      bring as good an animal as I need. He may be old, broken down, spavined,
      wind-broken, or lame; but if he is not sickly, or if his lameness is not
      from recent injury, it is
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span
      >not hard for him to haul a fair load ten or fifteen miles a day, when he
      is helped over the hard places.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now, if you pay fifty dollars for a horse, you can expect to sell him
      for about twenty or twenty-five dollars, unless you were greatly cheated,
      or have abused your brute while on the trip, both of which errors you must
      be careful to avoid. It is a simple matter of arithmetic to calculate what
      is best for you to do; but I hope on this horse question you may have the
      benefit of advice from some one who has had experience with the ways of
      the world. You will need it very much.
    </p>
    <h3>WAGONS.</h3>
    <p>
      If you have the choice of wagons, take one that is made for carrying
      light, bulky goods, for your baggage will be of that order. One with a
      large body and high sides, or a covered wagon, will answer. In districts
      where the roads are mountainous, rough, and rocky, wagons hung on
      thoroughbraces appear to suit the people the best; but you will have no
      serious difficulty with good steel springs if you put in rubber bumpers,
      and also strap the body to the axles, thus preventing the violent shutting
      and opening of the springs; for you must bear in mind that the main leaf
      of a steel spring is apt to break by the sudden pitching upward of the
      wagon-body.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been my fortune twice to have to carry large loads in small
      low-sided wagons; and it proved very convenient to have two or three
      half-barrels to keep food and small articles in, and to roll the bedding
      in rolls three or four feet wide, which were packed in the wagon upon
      their ends. The private baggage was carried in meal-bags, and the tents in
      bags made expressly to hold them; we could thus load the wagon securely
      with but little tying.
    </p>
    <p>
      For wagons with small and low bodies, it would be well to put a light rail
      fourteen to eighteen inches above the sides, and hold it there by six or
      eight posts resting on the floor, and confined to the sides of the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drive carefully and slowly over bad places. It makes a great deal of
      difference whether a wheel strikes a rock with the horse going at a trot,
      or at a walk.
    </p>
    <h3>HARNESS.</h3>
    <p>
      If your load is heavy, and the roads very hard, or the daily distance
      long, you had better have a collar for the horse: otherwise a
      breastplate-harness will do. In your kit of tools it is well to have a few
      straps, an awl, and waxed ends, against the time that something breaks.
      Oil the harness before you start, and carry about a pint of neat's-foot
      oil, which you can also use upon the men's
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span
      >boots. At night look out that the harness and all of your baggage are
      sheltered from dew and rain, rats and mice.
    </p>
    <h3>ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THIS MODE OF TRAVEL.</h3>
    <p>
      This way of travelling is peculiarly adapted to a party of different ages,
      rather than for one exclusively of young men. It is especially suitable
      where there are ladies who wish to walk and camp, or for an entire family,
      or for a school with its teachers. The necessity of a head to a party will
      hardly be recognized by young men; and, even if it is, they are still
      unwilling, as a general rule, to submit to unaccustomed restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way out of this difficulty is for one man to invite his comrades to
      join his party, and to make all the others understand, from first to last,
      that they are indebted to him for the privilege of going. It is then
      somewhat natural for the invited guests to look to their leader, and to be
      content with his decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best of men get into foolish dissensions when off on a jaunt, unless
      there is one, whose voice has authority in it, to direct the movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew a party of twenty or more that travelled in this way, and were
      directed by a trio composed of two gentlemen and one lady.<span
        class="pagenum"
        ><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span
      >
      This arrangement proved satisfactory to all concerned.<a
        id="FNanchor_5_5"

      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_5_5">[5]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been assumed in all cases that some one will lead the horse,—not
      ride in the loaded wagon,—and that two others will go behind and not far
      off, to help the horse over the very difficult places, as well as to have
      an eye on the load, that none of it is lost off, or scrapes against the
      wheels. Whoever leads must be careful not to fall under the horse or
      wagon, nor to fall under the horse's feet, should he stumble. These are
      daily and hourly risks: hence no small boy should take this duty.<a

    <h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
    <h3>CLOTHING.</h3>
    <p>
      If your means allow it, have a suit especially for the summer tour, and
      sufficiently in fashion to indicate that you are a traveller or camper.
    </p>
    <h3>SHIRTS.</h3>
    <p>
      Loose woollen shirts, of dark colors and with flowing collars, will
      probably always be the proper thing. Avoid gaudiness and too much
      trimming. Large pockets, one over each breast, are "handy;" but they spoil
      the fit of the shirt, and are always wet from perspiration. I advise you
      to have the collar-binding of silesia, and fitted the same as on a cotton
      shirt, only looser; then have a number of woollen collars (of different
      styles if you choose), to button on in the same manner as a linen collar.
      You can thus keep your neck cool or warm, and can wash the collars, which
      soil so easily, without washing the whole shirt. The shirt should reach
      nearly to the knees, to prevent disorders in the stomach and bowels. There
      are <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span
      >many who will prefer cotton-and-wool goods to all-wool for shirts. The
      former do not shrink as much, nor are they as expensive, as the latter.
    </p>
    <h3>DRAWERS.</h3>
    <p>
      If you wear drawers, better turn them inside out, so that the seams may
      not chafe you. They <i>must</i> be loose.
    </p>
    <h3>SHOES.</h3>
    <p>
      You need to exercise more care in the selection of shoes than of any other
      article of your outfit. Tight boots put an end to all pleasure, if worn on
      the march; heavy boots or shoes, with enormously thick soles, will weary
      you; thin boots will not protect the feet sufficiently, and are liable to
      burst or wear out; Congress boots are apt to bind the cords of the leg,
      and thus make one lame; short-toed boots or shoes hurt the toes; loose
      ones do the same by allowing the foot to slide into the toe of the boot or
      shoe; low-cut shoes continually fill with dust, sand, or mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      For summer travel, I think you can find nothing better than brogans
      reaching above the ankles, and fastening by laces or buttons as you
      prefer, but not so tight as to bind the cords of the foot. See that they
      bind nowhere except upon the instep. The soles should be wide, and the
      heels wide and low (about two and three-<span class="pagenum"
        ><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span
      >quarter inches wide by one inch high); have soles and heels well filled
      with iron nails. Be particular not to have steel nails, which slip so
      badly on the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Common brogans, such as are sold in every country-store, are the next best
      things to walk in; but it is hard to find a pair that will fit a difficult
      foot, and they readily let in dust and earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever you wear, break them in well, and oil the tops thoroughly with
      neat's-foot oil before you start; and see that there are no nails, either
      in sight or partly covered, to cut your feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      False soles are a good thing to have if your shoes will admit them: they
      help in keeping the feet dry, and in drying the shoes when they are wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Woollen or merino stockings are usually preferable to cotton, though for
      some feet cotton ones are by far the best. Any darning should be done
      smoothly, since a bunch in the stocking is apt to bruise the skin.
    </p>
    <h3>PANTALOONS.</h3>
    <p>
      Be sure to have the trousers loose, and made of rather heavier cloth than
      is usually worn at home in summer. They should be cut high in the waist to
      cover the stomach well, and thus prevent sickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of wearing "hip-pants," or using
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span
      >suspenders, is worth some attention. The yachting-shirt by custom is worn
      with hip-pantaloons, and often with a belt around the waist; and this
      tightening appears to do no mischief to the majority of people. Some,
      however, find it very uncomfortable, and others are speedily attacked by
      pains and indigestion in consequence of having a tight waist. If you are
      in the habit of wearing suspenders, do not change now. If you do not like
      to wear them over the shirt, you can wear them over a light under-shirt,
      and have the suspender straps come through small holes in the dress-shirt.
      In that case cut the holes low enough so that the dress-shirt will fold
      over the top of the trousers, and give the appearance of hip-pantaloons.
      If you undertake to wear the suspenders next to the skin, they will gall
      you. A fortnight's tramping and camping will about ruin a pair of
      trousers: therefore it is not well to have them made of any thing very
      expensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camping offers a fine opportunity to wear out old clothes, and to throw
      them away when you have done with them. You can send home by mail or
      express your soiled underclothes that are too good to lose or to be washed
      by your unskilled hands.<span class="pagenum"
        ><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span
      >
    </p>
    <hr style="width: 65%" />
    <h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
    <h3>STOVES AND COOKING-UTENSILS.</h3>
    <p>
      If you have a permanent camp, or if moving you have wagon-room enough, you
      will find a stove to be most valuable property. If your party is large it
      is almost a necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a permanent camp you can generally get something second-hand at a
      stove-dealer's or the junk-shop. For the march you will need a stove of
      sheet iron. About the simplest, smallest, and cheapest thing is a
      round-cornered box made of sheet iron, eighteen to twenty-four inches long
      and nine to twelve inches high. It needs no bottom: the ground will answer
      for that. The top, which is fixed, is a flat piece of sheet iron, with a
      hole near one end large enough for a pot or pan, and a hole (collar) for
      the funnel near the other end. It is well also to have a small hole, with
      a slide to open and close it with, in the end of the box near the bottom,
      so as to put in wood, and regulate the draught; but you can dispense with
      the slide by raising the stove
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span
      >from the ground when you want to admit fuel or air.
    </p>
    <div class="figleft" style="width: 212px">
      <img
        alt="Sheet-iron Stove"
        src="3_files/p40.png"
        title="Sheet-iron Stove"
        id="id-3266058689158660640"
        width="212"
        height="300"
      />
    </div>
    <p>
      I have used a more elaborate article than this. It is an old sheet-iron
      stove that came home from the army, and has since been taken down the
      coast and around the mountains with parties of ten to twenty. It was
      almost an indispensable article with such large companies. It is a
      round-cornered box, twenty-one inches long by twenty wide, and thirteen
      inches high, with a slide in the front end to admit air and fuel. The
      bottom is fixed to the body; the top removes, and is fitted loosely to the
      body after the style of a firkin-cover, i.e., the flange, which is deep
      and strong, goes <i>outside</i> the stove. There are two holes on the top
      5-1/2 inches in diameter, and two 7-1/2 inches, besides the collar for the
      funnel; <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span
      >and these holes have covers neatly fitted. All of the cooking-utensils
      and the funnel can be packed inside the stove; and, if you fear it may
      upset on the march, you can tie the handles of the stove to those of the
      top piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stove like this will cost about ten dollars; but it is a treasure for a
      large party or one where there are ladies, or those who object to having
      their eyes filled with smoke. The coffee-pot and tea-pot for this stove
      have "sunk bottoms," and hence will boil quicker by presenting more
      surface to the fire. You should cover the bottom of the stove with four
      inches or more of earth before making a fire in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prevent the pots and kettles from smutting every thing they touch, each
      has a separate bag in which it is packed and carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The funnel was in five joints, each eighteen inches long, and made upon
      the "telescope" principle, which is objectionable on account of the smut
      and the jams the funnel is sure to receive. In practice we have found
      three lengths sufficient, but have had two elbows made; and with these we
      can use the stove in an old house, shed, or tent, and secure good draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have ladies in your party, or those to whom the rough side of
      camping-out offers few attractions, it is well to consider this stove
      question. Either of these here described must be handled and transported
      with care.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      A more substantial article is the Dutch oven, now almost unknown in many
      of the States. It is simply a deep, bailed frying-pan with a heavy
      cast-iron cover that fits on and overhangs the top. By putting the oven on
      the coals, and making a fire on the cover, you can bake in it very well.
      Thousands of these were used by the army during the war, and they are
      still very extensively used in the South. If their weight is no objection
      to your plans, I should advise you to have a Dutch oven. They are not
      expensive if you can find one to buy. If you cannot find one for sale, see
      if you cannot improvise one in some way by getting a heavy cover for a
      deep frying-pan. It would be well to try such an improvisation at home
      before starting, and learn if it will bake or burn, before taking it with
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another substitute for a stove is one much used nowadays by
      camping-parties, and is suited for permanent camps. It is the top of an
      old cooking-stove, with a length or two of funnel. If you build a good
      tight fireplace underneath, it answers pretty well. The objection to it is
      the difficulty of making and keeping the fireplace tight, and it smokes
      badly when the wind is not favorable for draught. I have seen a great many
      of these in use, but never knew but one that did well in all weathers, and
      this had a fireplace nicely built of brick and mortar, and a tight iron
      door.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Still another article that can be used in permanent camps, or if you have
      a wagon, is the old-fashioned "Yankee baker," now almost unknown. You can
      easily find a tinman who has seen and can make one. There is not, however,
      very often an occasion for baking in camp, or at least most people prefer
      to fry, boil, or broil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camp-stoves are now a regular article of trade; many of them are good, and
      many are worthless. I cannot undertake to state here the merits or
      demerits of any particular kind; but before putting money into any I
      should try to get the advice of some practical man, and not buy any thing
      with hinged joints or complicated mechanism.<span class="pagenum"

    <h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
    <h3>COOKING, AND THE CARE OF FOOD.</h3>
    <p>
      When living in the open air the appetite is so good, and the pleasure of
      getting your own meals is so great, that, whatever may be cooked, it is
      excellent.

      You will need a frying-pan and a coffee-pot, even if you are carrying all
      your baggage upon your back. You can do a great deal of good cooking with
      these two utensils, after having had experience; and it is experience,
      rather than recipes and instructions, that you need. Soldiers in the field
      used to unsolder their tin canteens,
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span
      >and make two frying-pans of them; and I have seen a deep pressed-tin
      plate used by having two loops riveted on the edges opposite each other to
      run a handle through. Food fried in such plates needs careful attention
      and a low fire; and, as the plates themselves are somewhat delicate, they
      cannot be used roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is far better to carry a real frying-pan, especially if there are three
      or more in your party. If you have transportation, or are going into a
      permanent camp, do not think of the tin article.
    </p>
    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px">
      <img
        alt="Coffee-pot with Bail and Handle"

        title="Coffee-pot with Bail and Handle"

      />
    </div>
    <p>
      A coffee-pot with a bail and handle is better than one with a handle only,
      and a lip is better than a spout; since handles and spouts are apt to
      unsolder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young people are apt to put their pot or frying-pan on the burning wood,
      and it soon tips over. Also they let the pot boil over, and presently it
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span
      >unsolders for want of water. Few think to keep the handle so that it can
      be touched without burning or smutting; and hardly any young person knows
      that pitchy wood will give a bad flavor to any thing cooked over it on an
      open fire. Live coals are rather better, therefore, than the blaze of a
      new fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your frying-pan catches fire inside, do not get frightened, but take it
      off instantly, and blow out the fire, or smother it with the cover or a
      board if you cannot blow it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will do well to consult a cook-book if you wish for variety in your
      cooking; but some things not found in cook-books I will give you here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stale bread, pilot-bread, dried corn-cakes, and crumbs, soaked a few
      minutes in water, or better still in milk, and fried, are all quite
      palatable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In frying bread, or any thing else, have the fat boiling hot before you
      put in the food: this prevents it from soaking fat.
    </p>
    <h3>BAKED BEANS, BEEF, AND FISH.</h3>
    <p>
      Lumbermen bake beans deliciously in an iron pot that has a cover with a
      projecting rim to prevent the ashes from getting in the pot. The beans are
      first parboiled in one or two waters until the outside skin begins to
      crack. They are then put into the baking-pot, and salt pork
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span
      >at the rate of a pound to a quart and a half of dry beans is placed just
      under the surface of the beans. The rind of the pork should be gashed so
      that it will cut easily after baking. Two or three tablespoonfuls of
      molasses are put in, and a little salt, unless the pork is considerably
      lean. Water enough is added to cover the beans.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hole three feet or more deep is dug in the ground, and heated for an
      hour by a good hot fire. The coals are then shovelled out, and the pot put
      in the hole, and immediately buried by throwing back the coals, and
      covering all with dry earth. In this condition they are left to bake all
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the same principle very tough beef was cooked in the army, and made
      tender and juicy. Alternate layers of beef, salt pork, and hard bread were
      put in the pot, covered with water, and baked all night in a hole full of
      coals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fish may also be cooked in the same way. It is not advisable, however, for
      parties less than six in number to trouble themselves to cook in this
      manner.
    </p>
    <h3>CARE OF FOOD.</h3>
    <p>
      You had better <i>carry</i> butter in a tight tin or wooden box. In
      permanent camp you can sink it in strong brine, and it will keep some
      weeks. Ordinary butter will not keep sweet a long time in hot weather
      unless in a cool place or in brine. Hence it is better to replenish your
      stock often, if it is possible for you to do so.<span class="pagenum"
        ><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      You perhaps do not need to be told that when camping or marching it is
      more difficult to prevent loss of food from accidents, and from want of
      care, than when at home. It is almost daily in danger from rain, fog, or
      dew, cats and dogs, and from flies or insects. If it is necessary for you
      to take a large quantity of any thing, instead of supplying yourself
      frequently, you must pay particular attention to packing, so that it shall
      neither be spoiled, nor spoil any thing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot keep meats and fish fresh for many hours on a summer day; but
      you may preserve either over night, if you will sprinkle a little salt
      upon it, and place it in a wet bag of thin cloth which flies cannot go
      through; hang the bag in a current of air, and out of the reach of
      animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      In permanent camp it is well to sink a barrel in the earth in some dry,
      shaded place; it will answer for a cellar in which to keep your food cool.
      Look out that your cellar is not flooded in a heavy shower, and that ants
      and other insects do not get into your food.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lumbermen's way of carrying salt pork is good. They take a clean
      butter-tub with four or five gimlet-holes bored in the bottom near the
      chimbs. Then they pack the pork in, and cover it with coarse salt; the
      holes let out what little
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span
      >brine makes, and thus they have a dry tub. Upon the pork they place a
      neatly fitting "follower," with a cleat or knob for a handle, and then put
      in such other eatables as they choose. Pork can be kept sweet for a few
      weeks in this way, even in the warmest weather; and by it you avoid the
      continual risk of upsetting and losing the brine. Before you start, see
      that the cover of the firkin is neither too tight nor too loose, so that
      wet or dry weather may not affect it too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      I beg you to clean and wash your dishes as soon as you have done using
      them, instead of leaving them till the next meal. Remember to take
      dishcloths and towels, unless your all is a frying-pan and coffee-pot that
      you are carrying upon your back, when leaves and grass must be made to do
      dishcloth duty.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>

    <h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
    <h3>
      MARCHING.<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_7_7">[7]</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      It is generally advised by medical men to avoid violent exercise
      immediately after eating. They are right; but I cannot advise you to rest
      long, or at all, after breakfast, but rather to finish what you could not
      do before the meal, and get off at once while it is early and cool. Do not
      hurry or work hard at first if you can avoid it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the march, rest often whether you feel tired or not; and, when resting,
      see that you do rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most successful marching that I witnessed in the army was done by
      marching an hour, and resting ten minutes. You need not adhere strictly to
      this rule: still I would advise you to halt frequently for sight-seeing,
      but not to lie perfectly still more than five or ten minutes, as a
      reaction is apt to set in, and you will feel fatigued upon rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experience has shown that a man travelling
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span
      >with a light load, or none, will walk about three miles an hour; but you
      must not expect from this that you can easily walk twelve miles in four
      heats of three miles each with ten minutes rest between, doing it all in
      four and a half hours. Although it is by no means difficult, my advice is
      for you not to expect to walk at that rate, even through a country that
      you do not care to see. You may get so used to walking after a while that
      these long and rapid walks will not weary you; but in general you require
      more time, and should take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not be afraid to drink good water as often as you feel thirsty; but
      avoid large draughts of <i>cold</i> water when you are heated or are
      perspiring, and never drink enough to make yourself logy. You are apt to
      break these rules on the first day in the open air, and after eating
      highly salted food. You can often satisfy your thirst with simply rinsing
      the mouth. You may have read quite different advice<a
        id="FNanchor_8_8"
      ></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_8_8">[8]</a> from this,
      which applies to those who travel far from home, and whose daily changes
      bring them to water materially different from that of the day before.
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is well to have a lemon in the haversack or pocket: a drop or two of
      lemon-juice is a great help at times; but there is really nothing which
      will quench the thirst that comes the first few days of living in the open
      air. Until you become accustomed to the change, and the fever has gone
      down, you should try to avoid drinking in a way that may prove injurious.
      Base-ball players stir a little oatmeal in the water they drink while
      playing, and it is said they receive a healthy stimulus thereby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bathing is not recommended while upon the march, if one is fatigued or has
      much farther to go. This seems to be good counsel, but I do advise a good
      scrubbing near the close of the day; and most people will get relief by
      frequently washing the face, hands, neck, arms, and breast, when dusty or
      heated, although this is one of the things we used to hear cried down in
      the army as hurtful. It probably is so to some people: if it hurts you,
      quit it.
    </p>
    <h3>FOOT-SORENESS AND CHAFING.</h3>
    <p>
      After you have marched one day in the sun, your face, neck, and hands will
      be sunburnt, your feet sore, perhaps blistered, your limbs may be chafed;
      and when you wake up on the morning of the second day, after an almost
      sleepless night, you will feel as if you had been "dragged through seven
      cities."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not aware that there is any preventive of sunburn for skins that are
      tender. A hat is better to wear than a cap, but you will burn under
      either. Oil or salve on the exposed parts, applied before marching, will
      prevent some of the fire; and in a few days, if you keep in the open air
      all the time, it will cease to be annoying.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prevent foot-soreness, which is really the greatest bodily trouble you
      will have to contend with, you must have good shoes as already advised.
      You must wash your feet at least once a day, and oftener if they feel the
      need of it. The great preventive of foot-soreness is to have the feet,
      toes, and ankles covered with oil, or, better still, salve or
      mutton-tallow; these seem to act as lubricators. Soap is better than
      nothing. You ask if these do not soil the stockings. Most certainly they
      do. Hence wash your stockings often, or the insides of the shoes will
      become foul. Whenever you discover the slightest tendency of the feet to
      grow sore or to heat, put on oil, salve, or soap, immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      People differ as to these things. To some a salve acts as an irritant: to
      others soap acts in the same way. You must know before starting—your
      mother can tell you if you don't know yourself—how oil, glycerine, salve,
      and soap will affect your skin. Remember, the main thing is
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span
      >to keep the feet clean and lubricated. Wet feet chafe and blister more
      quickly than dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same rule applies to chafing upon any part of the body. Wash and
      anoint as tenderly as possible. If you have chafed in any part on previous
      marches, anoint it before you begin this.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the soldiers found their pantaloons were chafing them, they would tie
      their handkerchiefs around their pantaloons, over the place affected, thus
      preventing friction, and stopping the evil; but this is not advisable for
      a permanent preventive. A bandage of cotton or linen over the injured part
      will serve the purpose better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another habit of the soldiers was that of tucking the bottom of the
      pantaloons into their stocking-legs when it was dusty or muddy, or when
      they were cold. This is something worth remembering. You will hardly walk
      a week without having occasion to try it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leather leggins, such as we read about in connection with Alpine travel,
      are recommended by those who have used them as good for all sorts of
      pedestrianism. They have not come into use much as yet in America.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second day is usually the most fatiguing. As before stated, you suffer
      from loss of sleep (for few people can sleep much the first night in
      camp), you ache from unaccustomed work, smart
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span
      >from sunburn, and perhaps your stomach has gotten out of order. For these
      reasons, when one can choose his time, it is well to start on Friday, and
      so have Sunday come as a day of rest and healing; but this is not at all a
      necessity. If you do not try to do too much the first few days, it is
      likely that you will feel better on the third night than at any previous
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just said that your stomach is liable to become disordered. You
      will be apt to have a great thirst and not much appetite the first and
      second days, followed by costiveness, lame stomach, and a feeling of
      weakness or exhaustion. As a preventive, eat laxative foods on those
      days,—figs are especially good,—and try not to work too hard. You should
      lay your plans so as not to have much to do nor far to go at first. Do not
      dose with medicines, nor take alcoholic stimulants. Physic and alcohol may
      give a temporary relief, but they will leave you in bad condition. And
      here let me say that there is little or no need of spirits in your party.
      You will find coffee or tea far better than alcohol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avoid all nonsensical waste of strength, and gymnastic feats, before and
      during the march; play no jokes upon your comrades, that will make their
      day's work more burdensome. Young people are very apt to forget these
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let each comrade finish his morning nap. A
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span
      >man cannot dispense with sleep, and it is cruel to rob a friend of what
      is almost his life and health. But, if any one of your party requires more
      sleep than the others, he ought to contrive to "turn in" earlier, and so
      rise with the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have already been advised to take all the rest you can at the halts.
      Unsling the knapsack, or take off your pack (unless you lie down upon it),
      and make yourself as comfortable as you can. Avoid sitting in a draught of
      air, or wherever it chills you.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you feel on the second morning as if you could never reach your
      journey's end, start off easily, and you will limber up after a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great trouble with young people is, that they are ashamed to own their
      fatigue, and will not do any thing that looks like a confession. But these
      rules about resting, and "taking it easy," are the same in principle as
      those by which a horse is driven on a long journey; and it seems
      reasonable that young men should be favored as much as horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try to be civil and gentlemanly to every one. You will find many who wish
      to make money out of you, especially around the summer hotels and
      boarding-houses. Avoid them if you can. Make your prices, where possible,
      before you engage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not be saucy to the farmers, nor treat them
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span
      >as "country greenhorns." There is not a class of people in the country of
      more importance to you in your travels; and you are in honor bound to be
      respectful to them. Avoid stealing their apples, or disturbing any thing;
      and when you wish to camp near a house, or on cultivated land, obtain
      permission from the owner, and do not make any unreasonable request, such
      as asking to camp in a man's front-yard, or to make a fire in dry grass or
      within a hundred yards of his buildings. Do not ask him to wait on you
      without offering to pay him. Most farmers object to having people sleep on
      their hay-mows; and all who permit it will insist upon the rule, "No
      smoking allowed here." When you break camp in the morning, be sure to put
      out the fires wherever you are; and, if you have camped on cleared land,
      see that the fences and gates are as you found them, and do not leave a
      mass of rubbish behind for the farmer to clear up.
    </p>
    <h3>MOUNTAIN CLIMBING.</h3>
    <p>
      When you climb a mountain, make up your mind for hard work, unless there
      is a carriage-road, or the mountain is low and of gentle ascent. If
      possible, make your plans so that you will not have to carry much up and
      down the steep parts. It is best to camp at the foot of the mountain, or a
      part way up, and, leaving the most of your bag<span class="pagenum"
        ><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span
      >gage there, to take an early start next morning so as to go up and down
      the same day. This is not a necessity, however; but if you camp on the
      mountain-top you run more risk from cold, fog, (clouds), and showers, and
      you need a warmer camp and more clothing than down below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often there is no water near the top: therefore, to be on the safe side,
      it is best to carry a canteen. After wet weather, and early in the summer,
      you can often squeeze a little water from the moss that grows on
      mountain-tops.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is so apt to be chilly, cloudy, or showery at the summit, that you
      should take a rubber blanket and some other article of clothing to put on
      if needed. Although a man may sometimes ascend a mountain, and stay on the
      top for hours, in his shirt-sleeves, it is never advisable to go so thinly
      clad; oftener there is need of an overcoat, while the air in the valley is
      uncomfortably warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not wear the extra clothing in ascending, but keep it to put on when
      you need it. This rule is general for all extra clothing: you will find it
      much better to carry than to wear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that mountain-climbing is excessively fatiguing: hence go slowly,
      make short rests <i>very</i> often, eat nothing between meals, and drink
      sparingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are few mountains that it is advisable for ladies to try to climb.
      Where there is a road,
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span
      >or the way is open and not too steep, they may attempt it; but to climb
      over loose rocks and through scrub-spruce for miles, is too difficult for
      them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
    </p>
    <hr style="width: 65%" />
    <h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
    <h3>THE CAMP.</h3>
    <p>
      It pays well to take some time to find a good spot for a camp. If you are
      only to stop one night, it matters not so much; but even then you should
      camp on a dry spot near wood and water, and where your horse, if you have
      one, can be well cared for. Look out for rotten trees that may fall; see
      that a sudden rain will not drown you out; and do not put your tent near
      the road, as it frightens horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a permanent camp a good prospect is very desirable; yet I would not
      sacrifice all other things to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have to carry your baggage any distance by hand, you will find it
      convenient to use two poles (tent-poles will serve) as a hand-barrow upon
      which to pile and carry your stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      A floor to the tent is a luxury in which some indulge when in permanent
      camp. It is not a necessity, of course; but, in a tent occupied by ladies
      or children, it adds much to their comfort
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span
      >to have a few boards, an old door, or something of that sort, to step on
      when dressing. Boards or stepping-stones at the door of the tent partly
      prevent your bringing mud inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are on a hillside, pitch your tent so that when you sleep, if you
      are to sleep on the ground, your feet will be lower than your head: you
      will roll all night, and perhaps roll out of the tent if you lie across
      the line running down hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as you have pitched your tent, stretch a stout line from the front
      pole to the back one, near the top, upon which to hang your clothes. You
      can tighten this line by pulling inwards the foot of one pole before tying
      the line, and then lifting it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not put your clothes and bedding upon the bare ground: they grow damp
      very quickly. See, too, that the food is where ants will not get at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not forget to take two or three candles, and replenish your stock if
      you burn them: they sometimes are a prime necessity. Also do not pack them
      where you cannot easily find them in the dark. In a permanent camp you may
      be tempted to use a lantern with oil, and perhaps you will like it better
      than candles; but, when moving about, the lantern-lamp and oil-can will
      give you trouble. If you have no candlestick handy, you can use your
      pocket-knife, putting one blade in the bottom or side of the candle,
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span
      >and another blade into the ground or tent-pole. You can quickly cut a
      candlestick out of a potato, or can drive four nails in a block of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your candles get crushed, or if you have no candles, but have grease
      without salt in it, you can easily make a "slut" by putting the grease in
      a small shallow pan or saucer with a piece of wicking or cotton rag, one
      end of which shall be in the grease, and the other, which you light, held
      out of it. This is a poor substitute for daylight, and I advise you to
      rise and retire early (or "<i>turn in</i>" and "<i>turn out</i>" if you
      prefer): you will then have more daylight than you need.
    </p>
    <h3>BEDS.</h3>
    <p>
      Time used in making a bed is well spent. Never let yourself be persuaded
      that humps and hollows are good enough for a tired man. If you cut boughs,
      do not let large sticks go into the bed: only put in the smaller twigs and
      leaves. Try your bed before you "turn in," and see if it is comfortable.
      In a permanent camp you ought to take time enough to keep the bed soft;
      and I like best for this purpose to carry a mattress when I can, or to
      take a sack and fill it with straw, shavings, boughs, or what not. This
      makes a much better bed, and can be taken out daily to the air and sun. By
      this I avoid the clutter there always is inside a tent filled with
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span
      >boughs; and, more than all, the ground or floor does not mould in damp
      weather, from the accumulation of rubbish on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is better to sleep off the ground if you can, especially if you are
      rheumatic. For this purpose build some sort of a platform ten inches or
      more high, that will do for a seat in daytime. You can make a sort of
      spring bottom affair if you can find the poles for it, and have a little
      ingenuity and patience; or you can more quickly drive four large stakes,
      and nail a framework to them, to which you can nail boards or
      barrel-staves.<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_9_9">[9]</a> All this kind
      of work must be strong, or you can have no rough-and-tumble sport on it.
      We used to see in the army sometimes, a mattress with a bottom of rubber
      cloth, and a top of heavy drilling, with rather more cotton quilted<a
        id="FNanchor_10_10"
      ></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_10_10">[10]</a> between
      them than is put into a thick comforter. Such a mattress is a fine thing
      to carry in a wagon when you are on the march; but you can make a softer
      bed than this if you are in a permanent camp.
    </p>
    <h3>SLEEPING.</h3>
    <p>
      "Turn in" early, so as to be up with the sun. You may be tempted to sleep
      in your clothes; but if you wish to know what luxury is, take them
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span
      >off as you do at home, and sleep in a sheet, having first taken a bath,
      or at least washed the feet and limbs. Not many care to do this,
      particularly if the evening air is chilly; but it is a comfort of no mean
      order.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are short of bedclothes, as when on the march, you can place over
      you the clothes you take off (see
      <a href="#Page_19" class="pginternal">p. 19</a>); but in that case it is
      still more necessary to have a good bed underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will always do well to cover the clothes you have taken off, or they
      will be quite damp in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      See that you have plenty of air to breathe. It is not best to have a
      draught of air sweeping through the tent, but let a plenty of it come in
      at the feet of the sleeper or top of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hammock is a good thing to have in a permanent camp, but do not try to
      swing it between two tent-poles: it needs a firmer support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretch a clothes-line somewhere on your camp-ground, where neither you
      nor your visitors will run into it in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your camp is where many visitors will come by carriage, you will find
      that it will pay you for your trouble to provide a hitching-post where the
      horses can stand safely. Fastening to guy-lines and tent-poles is
      dangerous.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
    </p>
    <h3>SINKS.</h3>
    <p>
      In a permanent camp you must be careful to deposit all refuse from the
      kitchen and table in a hole in the ground: otherwise your camp will be
      infested with flies, and the air will become polluted. These sink-holes
      may be small, and dug every day; or large, and partly filled every day or
      oftener by throwing earth over the deposits. If you wish for health and
      comfort, do not suffer a place to exist in your camp that will toll flies
      to it. The sinks should be some distance from your tents, and a dry spot
      of land is better than a wet one. Observe the same rule in regard to all
      excrementitious and urinary matter. On the march you can hardly do better
      than follow the Mosaic law (see Deuteronomy xxiii. 12, 13).
    </p>
    <p>
      In permanent camp, or if you propose to stay anywhere more than three
      days, the crumbs from the table and the kitchen refuse should be carefully
      looked after: to this end it is well to avoid eating in the tents where
      you live. Swarms of flies will be attracted by a very little food.
    </p>
    <p>
      A spade is better, all things considered, than a shovel, either in
      permanent camp or on the march.<span class="pagenum"
        ><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span
      >
    </p>
    <h3>HOW TO KEEP WARM.</h3>
    <p>
      When a cold and wet spell of weather overtakes you, you will inquire, "How
      can we keep warm?" If you are where wood is very abundant, you can build a
      big fire ten or fifteen feet from the tent, and the heat will strike
      through the cloth. This is the poorest way, and if you have only
      shelter-tents your case is still more forlorn. But keep the fire a-going:
      you <i>can</i> make green wood burn through a pelting storm, but you must
      have a quantity of it—say six or eight large logs on at one time. You must
      look out for storms, and have some wood cut beforehand. If you have a
      stove with you, a little ingenuity will enable you to set it up inside a
      tent, and run the funnel through the door. But, unless your funnel is
      quite long, you will have to improvise one to carry the smoke away, for
      the eddies around the tent will make the stove smoke occasionally beyond
      all endurance. Since you will need but little fire to keep you warm, you
      can use a funnel made of boards, barrel-staves, old spout, and the like.
      Old tin cans, boot-legs, birch-bark, and stout paper can be made to do
      service as elbows, with the assistance of turf, grass-ropes, and large
      leaves. But I forewarn you there is not much fun, either in rigging your
      stove and funnel, or in sitting by it and waiting
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span
      >for the storm to blow it down. Still it is best to be busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way to keep warm is to dig a trench twelve to eighteen inches
      wide, and about two feet deep, running from inside to the outside of the
      tent. The inside end of the trench should be larger and deeper; here you
      build your fire. You cover the trench with flat rocks, and fill up the
      chinks with stones and turf; boards can be used after you have gone a few
      feet from the fireplace. Over the outer end, build some kind of a chimney
      of stones, boxes, boards, or barrels. The fireplace should not be near
      enough to the side of the tent to endanger it; and, the taller the chimney
      is, the better it will draw if you have made the trench of good width and
      air-tight. If you can find a sheet-iron covering for the fireplace, you
      will be fortunate; for the main difficulty in this heating-arrangement is
      to give it draught enough without letting out smoke, and this you cannot
      easily arrange with rocks. In digging your trench and fireplace, make them
      so that the rain shall not flood them.
    </p>
    <h3>FIREPLACE.</h3>
    <p>
      If flat rocks and mud are plenty, you can perhaps build a fireplace at the
      door of your tent (outside, of course), and you will then have something
      both substantial and valuable. Fold one
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span
      >flap of the door as far back as you can, and build one side of the
      fireplace against the pole,<a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_11_11">[11]</a> and the
      other side against, or nearly over to, the corner of the tent. Use large
      rocks for the lower tiers, and try to have all three walls perpendicular
      and smooth inside. When up about three feet, or as high as the flap of the
      tent will allow without its being scorched, put on a large log of green
      wood for a mantle, or use an iron bar if you have one, and go on building
      the chimney. Do not narrow it much: the chimney should be as high as the
      top of the tent, or eddies of wind will blow down occasionally, and smoke
      you out. Barrels or boxes will do for the top, or you can make a cob-work
      of split sticks well daubed with mud. All the work of the fireplace and
      chimney must be made air-tight by filling the chinks with stones or chips
      and mud. When done, fold and confine the flap of the tent against the
      stonework and the mantle; better tie than nail, as iron rusts the cloth.
      Do not cut the tent either for this or any other purpose: you will regret
      it if you do. Keep water handy if there is much woodwork; and do not leave
      your tent for a long time, nor go to sleep with a big fire blazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have to bring much water into camp, remember that two pails carry
      about as easily as <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span
      >a single one, provided you have a hoop between to keep them away from
      your legs. To prevent the water from splashing, put something inside the
      pail, that will float, nearly as large as the top of the pail.
    </p>
    <h3>HUNTERS' CAMP.</h3>
    <p>
      It is not worth while to say much about those hunters' camps which are
      built in the woods of stout poles, and covered with brush or the bark of
      trees: they are exceedingly simple in theory, and difficult in practice
      unless you are accustomed to using the axe. If you go into the woods
      without an axeman, you had better rely upon your tents, and not try to
      build a camp; for when done, unless there is much labor put in it, it is
      not so <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span
      >good as a shelter-tent. You can, however, cut a few poles for rafters,
      and throw the shelter-tent instead of the bark or brush over the poles.
      You have a much larger shelter by this arrangement of the tent than when
      it is pitched in the regular way, and there is the additional advantage of
      having a large front exposed to the fire which you will probably build; at
      the same time also the under side of the roof catches and reflects the
      heat downward. When you put up your tent in this way, however, you must
      look out not to scorch it, and to take especial care to prevent sparks
      from burning small holes in it. In fact, whenever you have a roaring fire
      you must guard against mischief from it.

    <h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
    <h3>TENTS.—ARMY SHELTER-TENT (<i>tente d'abri</i>).</h3>
    <p>
      The shelter-tent used by the Union soldiers during the Rebellion was made
      of light duck<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_12_12">[12]</a> about
      31-1/2 inches wide. A tent was made in two pieces both precisely alike,
      and each of them five feet long and five feet and two inches wide; i.e.,
      two widths of duck. One of these pieces or half-tents was given to every
      soldier. That edge of the piece which was the bottom of the tent was faced
      at the corners with a piece of stouter duck three or four inches square.
      The seam in the middle of the piece was also faced at the bottom, and
      eyelets were worked at these three places, through which stout cords or
      ropes could be run to tie this side of the tent down to the tent-pin, or
      to fasten it to whatever else was handy. Along the other three edges of
      each piece of tent, at intervals of about eight inches,
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span
      >were button-holes and buttons; the holes an inch, and the buttons four
      inches, from the selvage or hem.<a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_13_13">[13]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Two men could button their pieces at the tops, and thus make a tent
      entirely open at both ends, five feet and two inches long, by six to seven
      feet wide according to the angle of the roof. A third man could button his
      piece across one of the open ends so as to close it, although it did not
      make a very neat fit, and half of the cloth was not used; four men could
      unite their two tents by buttoning the ends together, thus doubling the
      length of the tent; and a fifth man could put in an end-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Light poles made in two pieces, and fastened together with ferrules so as
      to resemble a piece of fishing-rod, were given to some of the troops when
      the tents were first introduced into the army; but, nice as they were at
      the end of the march, few soldiers would carry them, nor will you many
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tents were also pitched by throwing them over a tightened rope; but it
      was easier to <i>cut</i> a stiff pole than to <i>carry</i> either the pole
      or rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      You need not confine yourself exactly to the dimensions of the army
      shelter-tent, but for a
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span
      >pedestrian something of the sort is necessary if he will camp out. I have
      never seen a "shelter" made of <i>three</i> breadths of drilling (seven
      feet three inches long), but I should think it would be a good thing for
      four or five men to take.<a id="FNanchor_14_14"></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_14_14">[14]</a> And I
      should recommend that they make three-sided end-pieces instead of taking
      additional half-tents complete, for in the latter case one-half of the
      cloth is useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five feet is <i>long</i> enough for a tent made on the "shelter"
      principle; when pitched with the roof at a right angle it is 3-1/2 feet
      high, and nearly seven feet wide on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although a shelter-tent is a poor substitute for a house, it is as good a
      protection as you can well carry if you propose to walk any distance. It
      should be pitched neatly, or it will leak. In
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span
      >heavy, pelting rains a fine spray will come through on the windward side.
      The sides should set at right angles to each other, or at a sharper angle
      if rain is expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are rubber blankets made with eyelets along the edges so that two
      can be tied together to make a tent; but they are heavier, more expensive,
      and not much if any better; and you will need other rubber blankets to lie
      upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish for a larger and more substantial covering than a "shelter,"
      and propose to do the work yourself, you will do well to have a sailmaker
      or a tent-maker cut the cloth, and show you how the work is to be done. If
      you cannot have their help, you must at least have the assistance of one
      used to planning and cutting needle-work, to whom the following hints may
      not be lost. We will suppose heavy drilling 29-1/2 inches wide to be used
      in all instances.
    </p>
    <h3>THE A-TENT.</h3>
    <p>
      To make an A-tent,<a id="FNanchor_15_15"></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_15_15">[15]</a> draw upon
      the floor a straight line seven feet long, to represent the upright pole
      or height of the tent; then draw a line at right angles to and across the
      end of the first one, to represent the ground or bottom of the tent.
      Complete the plan by finding where the corners will be on the ground line,
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span
      >and drawing the two sides (roof) from the corners<a
        id="FNanchor_16_16"
      ></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_16_16">[16]</a> to the top
      of the pole-line. This triangle is a trifle larger than the front and back
      of the tent will be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloth should be cut so that the twilled side shall be the outside of
      the tent, as it sheds the rain better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Place the cloth on the floor against the ground-line, and tack it (to hold
      it fast) to the pole-line, which it should overlap 3/8 of an inch; then
      cut by the roof-line. Turn the cloth over, and cut another piece exactly
      like the first; this second piece will go on the back of the tent. Now
      place the cloth against the ground-line as before, but upon the other side
      of the pole, and tack it to the floor after you have overlapped the
      selvage of the piece first cut 3/4 of an inch. Cut by the roof-line, and
      turn and cut again for the back of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      In cutting the four small gores for the corners, you can get all the cloth
      from one piece, and thus save waste, by turning and tearing it in two;
      these gore-pieces also overlap the longer breadths 3/4 of an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three breadths that make the sides or roof are cut all alike; their
      length is found by <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span
      >measuring the plan from corner to corner over the top; in the plan now
      under consideration, the distance will be nearly sixteen feet. When you
      sew them, overlap the breadths 3/4 of an inch the same as you do the
      end-breadths.
    </p>
    <p>
      In sewing you can do no better than to run, with a machine, a row of
      stitching as near each selvage as possible; you will thus have two rows to
      each seam, which makes it strong enough. Use the coarsest cotton, No. 10
      or 12.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sides and two ends are made separately; when you sew them together
      care must be taken, for the edges of the ends are cut cross-grained, and
      will stretch very much more than the cloth of the sides (roof). About as
      good a seam as you can make, in sewing together the sides and ends, is to
      place the two edges together, and fold them outwards (or what will be
      downwards when the tent is pitched) twice, a quarter of an inch each time,
      and put two rows of stitching through if done on a machine, or one if with
      sail-needle and twine. This folding the cloth six-ply, besides making a
      good seam, strengthens the tent where the greatest strain comes. It is
      also advisable to put facings in the two ends of the top of the tent, to
      prevent the poles from pushing through and chafing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bottom of the tent is completed next by folding upwards and inwards
      two inches of cloth
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span
      >to make what is called a "tabling," and again folding in the raw edge
      about a quarter of an inch, as is usual to make a neat job. Some makers
      enclose a marline or other small tarred rope to strengthen the foot of the
      tent, and it is well to do so. One edge of what is called the "sod-cloth"
      is folded in with the raw edge, and stitched at the same time. This cloth,
      which is six to eight inches wide, runs entirely around the bottom of the
      tent, excepting the door-flap, and prevents a current of air from sweeping
      under the tent, and saves the bottom from rotting; the sod-cloth, however,
      will rot or wear out instead, but you can replace it much more easily than
      you can repair the bottom of the tent; consequently it is best to put one
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      One door is enough in an A-tent; but, if you prefer two, be sure that one
      at least is nicely fitted and well provided with tapes or buttons, or
      both: otherwise you will have a cheerless tent in windy and rainy weather.
      The door-flap is usually made of a strip of cloth six to nine inches wide,
      sewed to the selvage of the breadth that laps inside; the top of it is
      sewed across the inside of the other breadth, and reaches to the corner
      seam. Tent-makers usually determine the height of the door by having the
      top of the flap reach from selvage to seam as just described; the narrower
      the flap <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span
      >is, the higher the door will be. Some make the door-flap considerably
      wider at the bottom than at the top, and thus provide against the many
      annoyances that arise from one too narrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loops (or "beckets" as they are called) that fasten to the tent-pins
      are put in one at each side of the door and at every seam. Some makers
      work an eyelet or put a grommet in the seam; but, in the army-tents which
      are made of duck, there are two eyelets worked, one on each side of the
      seam, and a six-thread manilla rope is run through and held in by knotting
      the ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door is tied together by two double rows of stout tapes<a
        id="FNanchor_17_17"
      ></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_17_17">[17]</a> sewed on
      at intervals of about eighteen inches; one inside the tent ties the
      door-flap to the opposite breadth, and a second set outside pulls together
      the two selvages of the centre breadths. Do not slight this work: a
      half-closed door, short tapes, and a door-flap that is slapping all the
      time, are things that will annoy you beyond endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upright poles of a tent such as has been described should be an inch
      or two more than seven feet, for the cloth will stretch. If you have a
      sod-cloth, the poles should be longer still.<a id="FNanchor_18_18"></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_18_18">[18]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
    </p>
    <h3>THE WALL-TENT.</h3>
    <p>
      The wall-tent is shaped like a house: the walls or sides, which are
      perpendicular, are four feet high. A continuous piece of cloth runs from
      the ground to the eaves, thence on toward the ridgepole, and down the
      other side to the ground. The tent is made on the same general principles
      as the one last described. It is four breadths square, but the width is
      usually diminished about one foot by cutting six inches from each corner
      breadth. If the cloth is drilling or light duck, you can overlap the
      centre breadths a foot, and thus have the doors ready-made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Draw a plan upon the floor as in the other case; the pole nine feet and
      two inches high, the corners four breadths apart less the overlappings and
      the narrowing; draw the wall (in the plan only) four feet and two inches
      high. The roof-line runs of course from the top of the pole to the top of
      the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cut the cloth, as before, so as to have the twilled side out. Add six
      inches to the distance measured on the plan, for the length of the walls
      and roof, so as to get cloth for the eaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wall is to be four feet high; consequently, when you have sewed
      together the four breadths that make the roof and walls, measure four feet
      3-1/2 inches from the ends (bottoms), double the
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span
      >cloth, and sew two rows of stitching by hand across from side to side,
      1-1/2 inches from the doubling; this makes the tabling for the eaves, and
      you have two inches left for the bottom tabling. Use stout twine for these
      seams at the eaves, and take only three to four stitches to the inch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take the same care as before in sewing together the ends and sides; the
      larger the tent, the more this difficulty increases.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sod-cloth becomes more of a necessity as we increase the size of the
      tent, and add to the difficulty of making it fit snugly to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Facings should be put in where the ends of the poles bear, as before
      explained; and also in the four upper corners of the wall, to prevent the
      strain of the corner guy-lines from ripping apart the eaves and wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beckets must be put in the bottom of each seam and the door, the same as
      in the A-tent, and strong tapes sewed to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy-lines made of six-thread manilla rope are put in at the four corners
      of the eaves, and at every seam along that tabling, making five upon each
      side. Work an eyelet, or put a grommet, in the doubled cloth of the seam;
      knot the end of the guy-line to prevent its pulling through: tying the
      rope makes too bungling a
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span
      >job, and splicing it is too much work. The six guy-lines in the body of
      the tent should be about nine feet long, the four corner ones about a foot
      longer. The fiddles<a id="FNanchor_19_19"></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_19_19">[19]</a> should be
      made of some firm wood: pine and spruce will not last long enough to pay
      for the trouble of making them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poles should be nine feet and four or five inches long. If they are
      too long at first, sink the ends in the ground, and do not cut them off
      until the tent has stretched all that it will.
    </p>
    <p>
      In permanent camp a "fly" over the tent is almost indispensable for
      protection from the heat and pelting rains. It should be as long as the
      roof of the tent, and project at least a foot beyond the eaves. The
      guy-lines should be a foot or more longer than those of the tent, so that
      the pins for the fly may be driven some distance outside those of the
      tent, and thus lift the fly well off the roof.
    </p>
    <h3>CLOTH FOR TENTS.</h3>
    <p>
      For convenience we have supposed all of the tents to be made of heavy
      drilling. Many tent-<span class="pagenum"
        ><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span
      >makers consider this material sufficiently strong, and some even use it
      to make tents larger than the United States army wall-tent. My own
      experience leads me to recommend for a wall-tent a heavier cloth, known to
      the trade as "eight-ounce Raven's" duck,<a id="FNanchor_20_20"></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_20_20">[20]</a> because
      drilling becomes so thin after it has been used two or three seasons that
      a high wind is apt to tear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cost of the cloth is about the same as the value of the labor of
      making the tent; but the difference between the cost of drilling and
      eight-ounce duck for a wall-tent of four breadths with a fly is only three
      to four dollars, and the duck tent will last nearly twice as long as the
      one of drilling. For these reasons it seems best not to put your labor
      into the inferior cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you use the tent, or expose to the weather any thing made of cotton
      cloth, you should wash it thoroughly in strong soap-suds, and then soak it
      in strong brine; this takes the sizing and oil out of the cloth, and if
      repeated from year to year will prevent mildew, which soon spoils the
      cloth. There are mixtures that are said to be better still, but a
      tent-maker <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span
      >assures me that the yearly washing is better than any thing applied only
      once. Some fishermen preserve their sails by soaking them in a solution of
      lime and water considerably thinner than whitewash. Others soak them in a
      tanner's vat; but the leather-like color imparted is not pleasing to the
      eye. Weak lime-water they say does not injure cotton; but it ruins rope
      and leather, and some complain that it rots the thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will save strain upon any tent, to stay it in windy weather with ropes
      running from the iron pins of the upright poles (which should project
      through the ridgepole and top of the tent) to the ground in front and rear
      of the tent. A still better way is to run four ropes from the top—two from
      each pole-pin—down to the ground near the tent-pins of the four corner
      guy-lines. The two stays from the rear pole should run toward the front of
      the tent; and the two front stays toward the rear, crossing the other two.
      The tent is then stayed against a wind from any quarter, and the stays and
      guy-lines are all together on the sides of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loosen the stays and guy-lines a little at night or when rain is
      approaching, so as to prevent them from straining the tent by shrinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the bottom of any tent you should dig a small trench to catch and
      convey away the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span
      >water when it rains; and I caution you against the error which even old
      campers sometimes make,—do not try to have the water run up hill.
    </p>
    <h3>HOW TO PITCH A WALL-TENT QUICKLY.</h3>
    <p>
      After you have once pitched the tent, and have put the poles and pins in
      their exact places, note the distance from one of the upright poles to the
      pin holding one of the nearest corner guy-lines, and then mark one of the
      poles in such a way that you can tell by it what that distance is. When
      you next wish to pitch the tent, drive two small pins in the ground where
      the two upright poles are to rest,—the ridgepole will tell you how far
      apart they must be,—then, by measuring with your marked pole, you can
      drive the four pins for the corner guys in their proper places.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next spread the tent on the ground, and put the ridgepole in its place in
      the top of the tent, and the two upright poles in their places. Then raise
      the tent. It will take two persons, or, if the tent is large, four or
      more, having first moved it bodily, to bring the feet of the upright poles
      to touch the two small pins that you drove at the beginning. You can now
      catch and tighten the corner guy-lines on the four pins previously driven.
      In driving the other pins, it looks well to have them on a line, if
      possible; also try to
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span
      >have the wall of the tent set square: to do this you must tie the door
      just right before you tighten a guy-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will find this way of pitching a tent convenient when a wind is
      blowing, or when your assistant is not a strong person. If the wind is
      very high, spread your tent to windward, and catch the windward guy-lines
      before raising the tent. You will thus avoid having it blown over.
    </p>
    <h3>TENT-POLES.</h3>
    <p>
      As tent-poles are not expensive, you may find it convenient to have two
      sets for each tent; one stout set for common use, and a lighter set to
      take when transportation is limited. Sound spruce, free from large knots
      and tolerably straight-grained, makes good poles; pine answers as well,
      but is more expensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upright poles of a stout set for a wall-tent of the United States Army
      pattern should be round or eight-sided, and about two inches in
      diameter.<a id="FNanchor_21_21"></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_21_21">[21]</a> If you
      prefer to have them square, round off the edges, or they will be badly
      bruised upon handling. Drive a stout iron pin<a id="FNanchor_22_22"></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_22_22">[22]</a> seven or
      eight inches long into the centre of the top until
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span
      >it projects only about three and a half or four inches, or enough to go
      through the ridgepole and an inch beyond. It will be necessary to bore a
      hole in the pole before driving in the pin, to prevent splitting. A
      ferrule is also serviceable on this end of the pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ridgepole should be well rounded on the edges, and be about two and a
      half inches wide and two inches thick. If made of stuff thinner than an
      inch and a half, it should be wider in the middle than above stated, or
      the pole will sag. Bore the holes to receive the pins of the uprights with
      an auger a size larger than the pins, so that they may go in and out
      easily: these holes should be an inch and a half from the ends. Ferrules
      or broad bands are desirable on the ends of the ridgepole; but if you
      cannot afford these you may perhaps be able to put a rivet or two through
      the pole between the ends and the holes, or, if not rivets, then screws,
      which are better than nothing to prevent the pin of the upright from
      splitting the ridgepole.
    </p>
    <h3>TENT-PINS.</h3>
    <div class="figleft" style="width: 26px">
      <img
        alt="Tent pin"
        src="3_files/p88.png"
        title="Tent pin"
        id="id-3486109577157228475"
        width="26"
        height="100"
      />
    </div>
    <p>
      Tent-pins should be made of sound hard wood; old wheel-spokes are
      excellent. Make them pointed at the bottom, so that they will drive
      easily; and notch them about two inches from the top, so that they will
      hold the rope. Cut away the wood from just above the notch
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span
      >towards the back of the head; this will prevent the notch of the pin from
      splitting off when it is driven. It is well to have pins differ in length
      and size: those for the corners and the stays should be the largest, say
      fifteen to eighteen inches long; and those for the wall and door may be
      eight or ten inches. But pins of these sizes are apt to pull out in a
      heavy storm; and so when you are to camp in one spot for some time, or
      when you see a storm brewing, it is well to make pins very stout, and two
      feet or more long, for the stays and four corner guy-lines, out of such
      stuff as you find at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loosen the pins by striking them on all four sides before you try to pull
      them up. A spade is a fine thing to use to pry out a pin that is deep in
      the ground, and a wooden mallet is better than an axe or hatchet to drive
      them in with; but, unless you have a large number of pins to drive, it
      will hardly pay you to get a mallet especially for this business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make a stout canvas bag to hold the tent-pins; and do not fold them loose
      with the tent, as it soils and wears out the cloth.
    </p>
    <h3>BEST SIZE OF TENTS.</h3>
    <p>
      The majority of people who go into permanent camp prefer tents
      considerably larger than the
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span
      >army wall-tent; but, unless your camp is well sheltered from the wind,
      you will have constant and serious troubles during every gale and
      thunder-storm, if you are in a large or high tent. A large tent is
      certainly more comfortable in fine weather; but you can make a small one
      sufficiently cheerful, and have a sense of security in it that you cannot
      feel in one larger. But, if you will have a large tent, make it of
      something heavier than drilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have two tents of the same height, you can connect the tops with a
      pole, and throw a fly, blanket, or sheet over it on pleasant days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not pack away a tent when it is damp if you can possibly avoid it, as
      it will mildew and decay in a few days of warm weather. If you are
      compelled to pack it when very damp, you can prevent decay by salting it
      liberally inside and out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you put away your tent for the season be sure that it is perfectly
      dry, and that the dead flies and grasshoppers are swept out of the inside.
      You should have a stout bag to keep it in, and to prevent its being chafed
      and soiled when it is handled and carried. You will find a hundred good
      uses for the bag in camp.<span class="pagenum"

    <h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
    <h3>MISCELLANEOUS.—GENERAL ADVICE.</h3>
    <p>
      If you travel horseback, singly or in parties, a previous experience in
      riding and in the care of your animal are necessary for pleasure. What is
      said about overloading applies here: you must go light; let your
      saddlebags be small, and packed so as not to chafe the horse. If you have
      the choice of a saddle, take a "McClellan" or a similar one, so that you
      can easily strap on your blankets and bags. If you have time before
      starting, try to teach your horse, what so few horses in the Northern
      States know, to be guided by the pressure of reins against the neck
      instead of a pull at the bit.
    </p>
    <h3>BOATING.</h3>
    <p>
      I do not propose to say much about boating, as the subject can hardly have
      justice done to it in a book of this sort. Parties of young men spend
      their summer vacation every year in camping and boating. It is a most
      delightful <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span
      >way,—superior in many respects to any other,—but it requires both
      experience and caution, neither of which is usually found in young men. So
      I hope that, if you will go in a boat, you may be an exception to the
      general rule, and will, for your parents' and friends' sake, take a small
      boat without ballast rather than a large one ballasted so heavily that it
      will sink when it fills.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you belay the sheets of your sail, make a knot that can be untied by
      a single pull at the loose end: any boatman will show you how to do this.
      <i>Never make fast the sheets in any other way.</i> Hold the sheets in
      your hands if the wind is at all squally or strong. Do not venture out in
      a heavy wind. Stow your baggage snugly before you start: tubs made by
      sawing a flour-barrel in two are excellent to throw loose stuff into.
      Remember to be careful; keep your eyes open, and know what you are going
      to do before you try it. The saying of an old sea-captain comes to me
      here: "I would rather sail a ship around the world, than to go down the
      bay in a boat sailed by a boy."
    </p>
    <h3>RECKONING LOST.</h3>
    <p>
      It often happens in travelling, that the sun rises in what appears the
      north, west, or south, and we seem to be moving in the wrong direc<span
        class="pagenum"
        ><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span
      >tion, so that when we return home our remembrance of the journey is
      confused. Perhaps a few hints on this subject may help the reader.
      Supposing your day's journey ends at Blanktown, where you find your
      compass-points apparently reversed. It then becomes natural for you to
      make matters worse by trying to lay out in your mind a new map, with
      Blanktown for the "hub," and east in the west, and so on. You can often
      prevent these mishaps, and can always make them less annoying, by studying
      your map well both before and during your journey; and by keeping in your
      mind continually, with all the vividness you can, what you are really
      doing. As far as Blanktown is concerned, you will have two impressions,
      just as we all have two impressions with regard to the revolution of the
      earth on its axis: apparently the sun rises, goes over and down; but in
      our minds we can see the sun standing still, and the earth turning from
      west to east.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon leaving Blanktown you are likely to carry the error along with you,
      and to find yourself moving in what appears to be the wrong way. Keep in
      mind with all the vividness possible, the picture of what you are really
      doing, and keep out of mind as much as you can the ugly appearance of
      going the wrong way. Every important change you make, be sure to "see
      it"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> in the mind's
      eye, and let the natural eye be blind to all that is deceiving. After a
      while things will grow real, and you must try to keep them so. The more
      perfectly you know the route and all its details, the less you will be
      troubled in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are travelling in the cars, and if you have a strong power of
      imagination, you can very easily right errors of this kind by learning
      from the map exactly what you are doing, and then by sitting next to the
      window, shut your eyes as you go around a curve that tends to aggravate
      the difficulty, and hold fast what you get on curves that help you. If you
      sit on the left side of the car, and look ahead, the cars seem to sweep
      continually a little to the right, and <i>vice versa</i>, when really
      moving straight ahead,—provided your imagination is good.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are travelling on an unknown road, you should always inquire all
      about it, to avoid taking the wrong one, which you are likely to do, even
      if you have a good map with you.
    </p>
    <h3>LADIES AS PEDESTRIANS.</h3>
    <p>
      I have once or twice alluded to ladies walking and camping. It is
      thoroughly practicable for them to do so. They must have a wagon, and do
      none of the heavy work; their gowns must
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span
      >not reach quite to the ground, and all of their clothing must be loose
      and easy.<a id="FNanchor_23_23"></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_23_23">[23]</a> Of course
      there must be gentlemen in the party; and it may save annoyance to have at
      least one of the ladies well-nigh "middle-aged." Ladies must be cared for
      more tenderly than men. If they are not well, the wagon should go back for
      them at the end of the day's march; shelter-tents are not to be
      recommended for them, nor are two blankets sufficient bedclothing. They
      ought not to be compelled to go any definite distance, but after having
      made their day's walk let the tents be pitched. Rainy weather is
      particularly unpleasant to ladies in tents; deserted houses, schoolhouses,
      saw-mills, or barns should be sought for them when a storm is brewing.
    </p>
    <h3>LADIES AND CHILDREN IN CAMP.</h3>
    <p>
      In a permanent camp, however, ladies, and children as well, can make
      themselves thoroughly at home.<a id="FNanchor_24_24"></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_24_24">[24]</a> They ought
      not to "rough it" so
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span
      >much as young men expect to: consequently they should be better protected
      from the wet and cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have seen a man with his wife and two children enjoy themselves through
      a week of rainy weather in an A-tent; but there are not many such happy
      families, and it is not advisable to camp with such limited
      accommodations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost all women will find it trying to their backs to be kept all day in
      an A-tent. If you have no other kind, you should build some sort of a
      wall, and pitch the tent on top of it. It is not a difficult or expensive
      task to put guy-lines and a wall of drilling on an A-tent, and make new
      poles, or pitch the old ones upon posts. In either case you should stay
      the tent with lines running from the top to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has already been advised that women should have a stove; in general,
      they ought not to depart so far from home ways as men do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rubber boots are almost a necessity for women and children during rainy
      weather and while the dew is upon the grass.<span class="pagenum"
        ><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span
      >
    </p>
    <h3>SUMMER-HOUSES, SHEDS, AND BRUSH SCREENS.</h3>
    <p>
      There is little to be said of the summer-houses built at the seaside near
      our large cities, since that is rather a matter of carpentry; nor of
      portable houses; nor of lattice-work with painted paper; nor even of a
      "schbang" such as I have often built of old doors, shutters, outer
      windows, and tarred paper: any one who is ingenious can knock together all
      the shelter his needs require or means allow. But, where you are camping
      for a week or more, it pays you well to use all you have in making
      yourself comfortable. A bush house, a canopy under which to eat, and
      something better than plain "out-of-doors" to cook in, are among the first
      things to attend to.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to plant firmly a tree that you have cut down, you may perhaps
      be able to drive a stake larger than the trunk of the tree; then loosen
      the stake by hitting it on the sides, and pull it out. You can do this
      when you have no shovel, or when the soil is too hard to dig. Small stakes
      wedged down the hole after putting in the tree will make it firm.
    </p>
    <h3>ETIQUETTE.</h3>
    <p>
      Some things considered essential at the home table have fallen into disuse
      in camp. It is pardonable, and perhaps best, to bring on whatever
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span
      >you have cooked in the dish that it is cooked in, so as to prevent its
      cooling off.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will also be allowed to help yourself first to whatever is nearest
      you, before passing it to another; for passing things around in camp is
      risky, and should be avoided as much as possible for that reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eat with your hats on, as it is more comfortable, and the wind is not so
      apt to blow your stray hairs into the next man's dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have no fork, do not mind eating with your knife and fingers. But,
      however much liberty you take, do not be rude, coarse, or uncivil: these
      bad habits grow rapidly in camp if you encourage them, and are broken off
      with difficulty on return.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is no separate knife for the butter, cheese, and meat, nor spoon
      for the gravy and soup, you can use your own by first wiping the knife or
      spoon upon a piece of bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be social and agreeable to all fellow-travellers you meet. It is a
      received rule now, I believe, that you are under no obligations to
      consider travelling-acquaintances as permanent: so you are in duty bound
      to be friendly to all thrown in your way. However, it is not fair to
      thrust your company upon others, nor compel a courtesy from any one. Try
      to remember too, that it is nothing wonderful to camp out or walk; and do
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span
      >not expect any one to think it is. We frequently meet parties of young
      folks walking through the mountains, who do great things with their
      tongues, but not much with their feet. If you will refrain from bragging,
      you can speak of your short marches without exciting contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avoid as much as possible asking another member of the party to do your
      work, or to wait upon you: it is surprising how easily you can make
      yourself disliked by asking a few trifling favors of one who is tired and
      hungry.
    </p>
    <h3>MOSQUITOES, BLACK FLIES, AND MIDGE.</h3>
    <p>
      These pests will annoy you exceedingly almost everywhere in the summer. In
      the daytime motion and perspiration keep them off to some extent. At
      night, or when lying down, you can do no better than to cover yourself so
      that they cannot reach your body, and have a mosquito-bar of some sort
      over your head. The simplest thing is a square yard of mosquito-netting
      thrown over the head, and tucked in well. You will need to have your hat
      first thrown over the head, and your shirt-collar turned up, to prevent
      the mosquitoes reaching through the mesh to your face and neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      A better way than this is to make a box-shaped mosquito-bar, large enough
      to stretch across the head of the bed, and cover the heads and shoul<span
        class="pagenum"
        ><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span
      >ders of all that sleep in the tent. It should be six or eight feet long,
      twenty to twenty-six inches wide, and one yard or more high. It will be
      more durable, but not quite so well ventilated, if the top is made of
      light cloth instead of netting. The seams should be bound with stout tape,
      and the sides and ends "gathered" considerably in sewing them to the top.
      Even then the side that falls over the shoulders of the sleepers may not
      be loose enough to fill the hollows between them; the netting will then
      have to be tucked under the blanket, or have something thrown over its
      lower edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sew loops or strings on the four upper corners, and corresponding loops or
      strings on the tent, so that you can tie up the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bobbinet lace is better than the common netting for all of these purposes.
      It comes in pieces twelve to fourteen yards long, and two yards wide. You
      cannot often find it for sale; but the large shops in the principal cities
      that do a great business by correspondence can send it to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oil of cedar and oil of pennyroyal are recommended as serviceable in
      driving off mosquitoes, and there are patented compounds whose labels
      pretend great things: you will try them only once, I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ammoniated opodeldoc rubbed upon the bites
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span
      >will in a great measure stop the itching, and hasten the cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      They say that a little gunpowder flashed in the tent will drive out flies
      and mosquitoes. I saw a man try it once, but noticed that he himself went
      out in a great hurry, while the flies, if they went at all, were back
      again before he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      A better thing, really the best, is a smudge made by building a small fire
      to the windward of your tent, and nearly smothering it with chips, moss,
      bark, or rotten wood. If you make the smudge in an old pan or pot, you can
      move it about as often as the wind changes.
    </p>
    <h3>HOW TO SKIN FISH.</h3>
    <p>
      When you camp by the seaside, you will catch cunners and other fish that
      need skinning. Let no one persuade you to slash the back fins out with a
      single stroke, as you would whittle a stick; but take a sharp knife, cut
      on both sides of the fin, and then pull out the whole of it from head to
      tail, and thus save the trouble that a hundred little bones will make if
      left in. After cutting the skin on the under side from head to tail, and
      taking out the entrails and small fins, start the skin where the head
      joins the body, and pull it off one side at a time. Some men stick an awl
      through a cunner's head, or catch it fast in a stout iron hook, to hold it
      while skinning.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Cunners and lobsters are sometimes caught off bold rocks in a net. You can
      make one easily out of a hogshead-hoop, and twine stretched across so as
      to make a three-inch mesh.<a id="FNanchor_25_25"></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_25_25">[25]</a> Tie a lot
      of bait securely in the middle, sink it for a few minutes, and draw up
      rapidly. The rush of water through the net prevents the fish from
      escaping.
    </p>
    <h3>EXPENSES.</h3>
    <p>
      The expenses of camping or walking vary greatly, of course, according to
      the route, manner of going, and other things. The principal items are
      railroad-tickets, horse and wagon hire, trucking, land-rent (if you camp
      where rent is charged), and the cost of the outfit. You ought to be able
      to reckon very nearly what you will have to pay on account of these before
      you spend a cent. After this will come the calculation whether to travel
      at all by rail, supposing you wish to go a hundred miles to reach the
      seaside where you propose to camp, or the mountains you want to climb. If
      you have a horse and wagon, or are going horseback, it will doubtless be
      cheaper to march than to ride and pay freight. If time is plenty and money
      is <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span
      >scarce, you may perhaps be able to walk the distance cheaper than to go
      by rail; but, if you lodge at hotels, you will find it considerably more
      expensive. The question then is apt to turn on whether the hundred miles
      is worth seeing, and whether it is so thickly settled as to prevent your
      camping.
    </p>
    <p>
      To walk a hundred miles, carrying your kit all the way, will take from one
      to two weeks, according to your age, strength, and the weather. We have
      already stated that there is little <i>pleasure</i> in walking more than
      sixty miles a week. But if you wish to go as fast as you can, and have
      taken pains to practise walking before starting, and can buy your food in
      small quantities daily, and can otherwise reduce your baggage, you can
      make the hundred miles in a week without difficulty, and more if it is
      necessary, unless there is much bad weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expense for food will also vary according to one's will; but it need
      not be heavy if you can content yourself with simple fare. You can hardly
      live at a cheaper rate than the following:—
    </p>
    <h3>ONE WEEK'S SUPPLY FOR TWO MEN.</h3>
    <p>
      Ten pounds of pilot-bread; eight pounds of salt pork; one pound of coffee
      (roasted and ground); one to two pounds of sugar (granu<span
        class="pagenum"
        ><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span
      >lated); thirty pounds of potatoes (half a bushel).<a
        id="FNanchor_26_26"
      ></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_26_26">[26]</a> A little
      beef and butter, and a few ginger-snaps, will be good investments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supposing you and I were to start from home in the morning after
      breakfast; when noon comes, we eat the lunch we have taken with us, and
      press on. As the end of the day's march approaches, we look out to buy two
      quarts of potatoes at a farmhouse or store; and we boil or fry, or boil
      and mash in milk, enough of these for our supper. The breakfast next
      morning is much the same. We cook potatoes in every way we know, and eat
      the whole of our stock remaining, thus saving so much weight to carry. We
      also soak some pilot-bread, and fry that for a dessert, eating a little
      sugar on it if we can spare it. When dinner-time approaches, we keep a
      lookout for a chance to buy ten or twelve cents' worth of bread or
      biscuits. These are more palatable than the pilot-bread or crackers in our
      haversack. If we have a potato left from breakfast, we cook and eat it
      now. We cut off a slice of the corned beef, and take a nibble at the
      ginger-snaps. If we think we can afford three or four cents more, we buy a
      pint of milk, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span
      >and make a little dip-toast. And so we go; sometimes we catch a fish, or
      pass an orchard whose owner gives us all the windfalls we want. We pick
      berries too; and keep a sharp lookout that we supply ourselves in season
      when our pilot-bread, sugar, pork, and butter run low. Some days we
      overtake farmers driving ox-carts or wagons; we throw our kits aboard, and
      walk slowly along, willing to lose a little time to save our aching
      shoulders. And in due time, if no accident befalls, nor rainy weather
      detains us, we arrive at our seashore or mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may like to know that this is almost an exact history, at least as far
      as eating is concerned, of a twelve days' tramp I once went on in company
      with two other boys. There was about five dollars in the party, and nearly
      two dollars of this was spent in paying toll on a boat that we took
      through a canal a part of the way. We carried coffee, sugar, pork, and
      beef from home, and ate potatoes three times a day. We had a delightful
      time, and came home fattened up somewhat; but I will admit that I did not
      call for potatoes when I got back to my father's table, for some days.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, however, it will be noticed that those who camp out for the
      season, or go on walking-tours, do so at a moderate expense
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span
      >because they start with the determination to make it cheap. For this
      purpose they content themselves with old clothes, which they fit over or
      repair, take cooking-utensils from their own kitchen, and, excepting in
      the matter of canned foods, do not live very differently from what they do
      at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly all the parties of boys that I have questioned spend all the money
      they have, be it little or much. Generally those I have met walking or
      camping seem to be impressed with the magnitude of their operations, and
      to be carrying constantly with them the determination to spend their funds
      sparingly enough to reach home without begging. It is not bad practice for
      a young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I wish to say a word to parents—having been a boy myself, and being
      now a father. Let your boys go when summer comes; put them to their wits;
      do not let them be extravagant, nor have money to pay other men for
      working for them. It is far better for them to move about than to remain
      in one place all the time. The last, especially if the camp is near some
      place of public resort, tends to encourage idleness and dissipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you return home again from a tour of camping, and go back to a
      sedentary life, remember that you do not need to eat all that
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span
      >your appetite calls for. You may make yourself sick if you go on eating
      such meals as you have been digesting in camp. You are apt also upon your
      return to feel as you did on the first and second days of your tour; this
      is especially liable to be the case if you have overworked yourself, or
      have not had enough sleep.<span class="pagenum"

    <h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
    <h3>DIARY.</h3>
    <p>
      By all means keep a diary: the act of writing will help you to remember
      these good times, and the diary will prove the pleasantest of reading in
      after-years. It is not an easy thing to write in camp or on the march, but
      if it costs you an effort you will prize it all the more. I beg you to
      persevere, and, if you fail, to "try, try again." I cannot overcome the
      desire to tell you the results of my experience in diary-writing; for I
      have tried it long, and under many different circumstances. They are as
      follows:—
    </p>
    <p>
      First, Any thing written at the time is far better than no record at all;
      so, if you can only write a pocket diary with lead pencil, do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, All such small diaries, scraps, letters, and every thing written
      illegibly or with lead pencil, are difficult to preserve or to read, and
      are very unhandy for reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third, It is great folly to persuade yourself that after taking notes for
      a week or two, or
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span
      >writing a hurried sketch, you can extend or copy and illuminate at your
      leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently, write what you can, and let it stand with all its blots,
      errors, and nonsense. And be careful, when you are five years older, not
      to go through the diary with eraser and scissors; for, if you live still
      another five years, nothing will interest you more than this diary with
      all its defects.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find after having written many diaries of many forms, that I have now to
      regret I did not at first choose some particular size, say "letter-size,"
      and so have had all my diaries uniform. I will never again use
      "onion-skin," which is too thin, nor any odd-shaped, figured, cheap, or
      colored paper. I do not like those large printed diaries which give you
      just a page or half-page a day, nor a paper whose ruling shows
      conspicuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like best when at home to write in a blank book; and when I go off on a
      summer vacation I leave that diary safely at home, and take a portfolio
      with some sheets of blank paper upon which to write the diary, and mail
      them as fast as written. These answer for letters to the friends at home,
      and save writing any more to them. They also, when bound, form a diary
      exclusively of travels. When I return I write an epitome in the
      home-diary, and thus prevent a
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span
      >break of dates in that book. The paper for the diary of travels is
      strong, but rather thin and white. I buy enough of it at once to make a
      volume, and thus have the diary sheets uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am quite sure that you will do well to write a diary of your summer
      vacation, upon the plan just named, whether you keep one at home or not.
      Try to do it well, but do not undertake too much. Write facts such as what
      you saw, heard, did, and failed to do; but do not try to write poetry or
      fine writing of any kind. Mention what kind of weather; but do not attempt
      a meteorological record unless you have a special liking for that science.
      If you camp in Jacob Sawyer's pasture, and he gives you a quart of milk,
      say so, instead of "a good old man showed us a favor;" for in after-years
      the memory of it will be sweeter than the milk was, and it will puzzle you
      to recall the "good old man's" name and what the favor was. If you have
      time, try to draw: never mind if it is a poor picture. I have some of the
      strangest-looking portraits and most surprising perspectives in my diaries
      written when fifteen to twenty years old; but I would not exchange them
      now for one of the "old masters." Do not neglect the narrative, however,
      for sake of drawing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have noticed that when my paper is down in the bottom of a valise, and
      the pen in a wallet,
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span
      >and the penholder in a coat-pocket, and portfolio somewhere else, it is
      not so easy to "find time to write" as when I have penholder, pen, and
      paper in the portfolio, and the portfolio and ink in my haversack. Under
      these favorable conditions it is easy to snatch a few moments from any
      halt; and a diary written on the spur of the moment is a diary that will
      be worth reading in after-life. If it is impossible, however, as it so
      often is, to write oftener than once a day, you will do well to make a
      note of events as fast as they happen, so that you shall not forget them,
      nor have to stop to recall them when your time is precious.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have heard of diaries with side-notes on each page, and even an index at
      the end of the book; but not many men, and but few boys, can do all this;
      and my advice to the average boy is, not to undertake it, nor any thing
      else that will use the time, patience, and perseverance, needed to write
      the narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will find it convenient for reference if you make a paragraph of every
      subject. Date every day distinctly, with a much bolder handwriting than
      the body of the diary; and write the date on the right margin of the right
      page, and left margin of the left page, with the year at the top of the
      page only. Skip a line or two instead of ruling between the days.

    <h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
    <h3>"HOW TO DO IT."</h3>
    <p>
      The following advice by Rev. Edward Everett Hale is so good that I have
      appropriated it. You will find more good advice in the same book.<a
        id="FNanchor_27_27"
      ></a
      ><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_27_27">[27]</a>
    </p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        "First, never walk before breakfast. If you like you may make two
        breakfasts, and take a mile or two between; but be sure to eat something
        before you are on the road.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Second, do not walk much in the middle of the day. It is dusty and hot
        then; and the landscape has lost its special glory. By ten o'clock you
        ought to have found some camping-ground for the day,—a nice brook
        running through a grove; a place to draw, or paint, or tell stories, or
        read them or write them; a place to make waterfalls and dams, to sail
        chips, or build boats; a place to make a fire and a cup of tea for the
        oldsters. Stay here till four in the afternoon, and then push on in the
        two or three <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span
        >hours which are left to the sleeping-place agreed upon. Four or five
        hours on the road is all you want in each day. Even resolute idlers, as
        it is to be hoped you all are on such occasions, can get eight miles a
        day out of that; and that is enough for a true walking-party. Remember
        all along that you are not running a race with the railway-train. If you
        were, you would be beaten certainly; and the less you think you are, the
        better. You are travelling in a method of which the merit is that it is
        not fast, and that you see every separate detail of the glory of the
        world. What a fool you are, then, if you tire yourself to death, merely
        that you may say that you did in ten hours what the locomotive would
        gladly have finished in one, if by that effort you have lost exactly the
        enjoyment of nature and society that you started for!"
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The advice to rest in the heat of the day is good for very hot weather;
      young people, however, are too impatient to follow it unless there is an
      apparent necessity. The feeling at twelve o'clock that you have yet to
      walk as far as you have come is not so pleasant as that of knowing you
      have all the afternoon for rest. For this reason nearly every one will
      finish the walk as soon as possible; still Mr. Hale's plan is a good
      one—the best for very hot weather.<span class="pagenum"
        ><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span
      >
    </p>
    <h3>STILL ANOTHER WAY TO TRAVEL.</h3>
    <p>
      Mr. Hale also tells an amusing story of his desire when young to sail down
      the Connecticut River; but he was dissuaded from doing so when the chance
      finally came, by people who thought the road was the only place to travel
      in. And now he is sorry he did not sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reading of his story brings to mind a similar experience that I had
      when young, and it is now one of the keen regrets of my manhood, that I
      likewise was laughed out of a boyish plan that would have given me untold
      pleasure and profit had it been carried out. I loved to walk, and I wanted
      to see the towns within a circuit of twenty or thirty miles of home; but I
      could not afford to pay hotel-bills, and I was not strong enough to carry
      a camping-outfit. But I had an old cart, strong and large enough to hold
      all I should need. I could load it with the same food that I should eat if
      I staid at home; could wear my old clothes, take my oilcloth overcoat, an
      axe, frying-pan, pail, and a borrowed tent and poles; and I would learn
      the county by heart before vacation was over, and not cost my father a
      cent more than if I staid at home. Oh, why didn't I go! Simply because I
      was laughed out of it. I was told that people did not travel in that way;
      I should be arrested; the boys would hoot at and
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span
      >stone me; the men would set their dogs on me; I should be driven out of
      my camping-place; thieves would steal my seventy-five cent cart; dogs
      would eat up my stock of food; and the first man who overtook me would
      tell the people that a crazy boy from Portland was coming along the road
      dragging a baby-wagon, whereupon every woman would leave her kitchen, and
      every man his field, to see and laugh at me. But, above all, the thing
      would be known in our neighborhood, and the boys and girls would join in
      their abuse of the county explorer.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the end of it; the being made sport of by <i>my own friends</i>,
      and hearing the <i>small boys in our street</i> sing out "How's your
      cart?" and to be known all through life perhaps as "<i>one-horse John</i
      >"—the punishment would be too severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, my young friends, I made a great mistake; and I want to caution you
      <i>not</i> to surrender to any such nonsense as I did. If you wish to go
      to sea in a skiff, it is well to give in to a fisherman's advice to stay
      at home, for he can assure you that winds and waves will be the death of
      you; but if you have a good hand-wagon, and are willing to stand a few
      taunts, by all means go on your walk, and pull your wagon after you. You
      will learn a lesson in independence that will be of value to you, if you
      learn nothing else.<span class="pagenum"

    <h3>ACCIDENTS.</h3>
    <p>
      The secret of safe <i>climbing</i> is never to relax one hold until
      another is secured; it is in spirit equally applicable to scrambling over
      rocks, a particularly difficult thing to do safely with a loaded gun. Test
      rotten, slippery, or otherwise suspicious holds, before trusting them. In
      lift<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span
      >ing the body up anywhere, keep the mouth shut, breathe through the
      nostrils, and go slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <i>swimming</i> waste no strength unnecessarily in trying to stem a
      current; yield partly, and land obliquely lower down; if exhausted, float:
      the slightest motion of the hands will ordinarily keep the face above
      water; in any event keep your wits collected. In fording deeply, a heavy
      stone [in the hands, above water] will strengthen your position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never sail a boat experimentally: if you are no sailor, take one with you,
      or stay on land.
    </p>
    <p>
      In crossing a high narrow foot-path, never look lower than your feet; the
      muscles will work true if not confused with faltering instructions from a
      giddy brain. On soft ground see what, if any thing, has preceded you;
      large hoof-marks generally mean that the way is safe: if none are found,
      inquire for yourself before going on. Quicksand is the most treacherous
      because far more dangerous than it looks; but I have seen a mule's ears
      finally disappear in genuine mud.

      Cattle-paths, however erratic, commonly prove the surest way out of a
      difficult place, whether of uncertain footing or dense undergrowth.

    <h3>"TAKING COLD."</h3>
    <p>
      This vague "household word" indicates one or more of a long varied train
      of unpleasant affec<span class="pagenum"
        ><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span
      >tions nearly always traceable to one or the other of only two causes,—<i
        >sudden change</i
      >
      of temperature, and <i>unequal distribution</i> of temperature. No
      extremes of heat or cold can alone affect this result: persons frozen to
      death do not "take cold" during the process. But if a part of the body be
      rapidly cooled, as by evaporation from a wet article of clothing, or by
      sitting in a draught of air, the rest of the body remaining at an ordinary
      temperature; or if the temperature of the whole be suddenly changed by
      going out into the cold, or especially by coming into a warm room,—there
      is much liability of trouble.
    </p>
    <p>There is an old saying,—</p>
    <div class="center">

    <p>
      And I should think almost any one could get a "cold " with a spoonful of
      water on the wrist held to a key-hole. Singular as it may seem, sudden
      warming when cold is more dangerous than the reverse: every one has
      noticed how soon the handkerchief is required on entering a heated room on
      a cold day. Frost-bite is an extreme illustration of this. As the Irishman
      said on picking himself up, it was not the fall, but stopping so quickly,
      that hurt him: it is not the lowering of the temperature to freezing
      point, but its subsequent elevation, that devi<span class="pagenum"
        ><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span
      >talizes the tissue. This is why rubbing with snow, or bathing in cold
      water, is required to restore safely a frozen part: the arrested
      circulation must be very gradually re-established, or inflammation,
      perhaps mortification, ensues.
    </p>
    <p>
      General precautions against taking cold are almost self-evident in this
      light. There is ordinarily little if any danger to be apprehended from wet
      clothes, so long as exercise is kept up; for the "glow" about compensates
      for the extra cooling by evaporation. Nor is a complete drenching more
      likely to be injurious than wetting of one part. But never sit still wet,
      and in changing rub the body dry. There is a general tendency, springing
      from fatigue, indolence, or indifference, to neglect damp feet,—that is to
      say, to dry them by the fire; but this process is tedious and uncertain. I
      would say especially, "Off with muddy boots and sodden socks at once:" dry
      stockings and slippers after a hunt may make just the difference of your
      being able to go out again, or never. Take care never to check
      perspiration: during this process the body is in a somewhat critical
      condition, and the sudden arrest of the function may result disastrously,
      even fatally. One part of the business of perspiration is to equalize
      bodily temperature, and it must not be interfered with. The secret of much
      that is said about <i>bathing</i> when heated
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span
      >lies here. A person overheated, panting it may be, with throbbing temples
      and a <i>dry</i> skin, is in danger partly because the natural cooling by
      evaporation from the skin is denied; and this condition is sometimes not
      far from a "sunstroke." Under these circumstances, a person of fairly good
      constitution may plunge into the water with impunity, even with benefit.
      But, if the body be already cooling by sweating, rapid abstraction of heat
      from the surface may cause internal congestion, never unattended with
      danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drinking ice-water offers a somewhat parallel case; even on stopping to
      drink at the brook, when flushed with heat, it is well to bathe the face
      and hands first, and to taste the water before a full draught. It is a
      well-known excellent rule, not to bathe immediately after a full meal;
      because during digestion the organs concerned are
      <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'comparativey'"
        >comparatively</ins
      >
      engorged and any sudden disturbance of the circulation may be disastrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The imperative necessity of resisting drowsiness under extreme cold
      requires no comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In walking under a hot sun, the head may be sensibly protected by green
      leaves or grass in the hat; they may be advantageously moistened, but not
      enough to drip about the ears. Under such circumstances the slightest
      giddiness, dimness of sight, or confusion of ideas, should
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span
      >be taken as a warning of possible sunstroke, instantly demanding rest,
      and shelter if practicable.
    </p>
    <h3>HUNGER AND FATIGUE</h3>
    <p>
      are more closely related than they might seem to be: one is a sign that
      the fuel is out, and the other asks for it. Extreme fatigue, indeed,
      destroys appetite: this simply means temporary incapacity for digestion.
      But, even far short of this, food is more easily digested and better
      relished after a little preparation of the furnace. On coming home tired
      it is much better to make a leisurely and reasonably nice toilet, than to
      eat at once, or to lie still thinking how tired you are; after a change
      and a wash you feel like a "new man," and go to the table in capital
      state. Whatever dietetic irregularities a high state of civilization may
      demand or render practicable, a normally healthy person is inconvenienced
      almost as soon as his regular mealtime passes without food; and few can
      work comfortably or profitably fasting over six or eight hours. Eat before
      starting; if for a day's tramp, take a lunch; the most frugal meal will
      appease if it do not satisfy hunger, and so postpone its urgency. As a
      small scrap of practical wisdom, I would add, Keep the remnants of the
      lunch if there be any; for you cannot always be sure of getting in to
      supper.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
    </p>
    <h3>STIMULATION.</h3>
    <p>
      When cold, fatigued, depressed in mind, and on other occasions, you may
      feel inclined to resort to artificial stimulus. Respecting this many-sided
      theme I have a few words to offer—of direct bearing on the collector's
      case. It should be clearly understood, in the first place, that a
      stimulant confers no strength whatever: it simply calls the powers that be
      into increased action, at their own expense. Seeking real strength in
      stimulus is as wise as an attempt to lift yourself up by your boot-straps.
      You may gather yourself to leap the ditch, and you clear it; but no such
      muscular energy can be sustained: exhaustion speedily renders further
      expenditure impossible. But now suppose a very powerful mental impression
      be made, say the circumstance of a succession of ditches in front, and a
      mad dog behind: if the stimulus of terror be sufficiently strong, you may
      leap on till you drop senseless. Alcoholic stimulus is a parallel case,
      and is not seldom pushed to the same extreme. Under its influence you
      never can tell when you <i>are</i> tired; the expenditure goes on, indeed,
      with unnatural rapidity, only it is not felt at the time; but the upshot
      is, you have all the original fatigue to endure and to recover from,
      <i>plus</i> the fatigue resulting from over-exci<span class="pagenum"
        ><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span
      >tation of the system. Taken as a fortification against cold, alcohol is
      as unsatisfactory as a remedy for fatigue. Insensibility to cold does not
      imply protection. The fact is, the exposure is greater than before; the
      circulation and respiration being hurried, the waste is greater; and, as
      sound fuel cannot be immediately supplied, the temperature of the body is
      soon lowered. The transient warmth and glow over the system has both cold
      <i>and</i> depression to endure. There is no use in borrowing from
      yourself, and fancying you are richer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, the value of any stimulus (except in a few exigencies of disease
      or injury) is in proportion, not to the intensity, but to the equableness
      and durability, of its effect. This is one reason why tea, coffee, and
      articles of corresponding qualities, are preferable to alcoholic drinks:
      they work so smoothly that their effect is often unnoticed, and they "stay
      by" well. The friction of alcohol is tremendous in comparison. A glass of
      grog may help a veteran over the fence; but no one, young or old, can
      shoot all day on whiskey.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have had so much experience in the use of tobacco as a mild stimulant,
      that I am probably no impartial judge of its merits. I will simply say, I
      do not use it in the field, because it indisposes to muscular activity,
      and favors reflection
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span
      >when observation is required; and because temporary abstinence provokes
      the morbid appetite, and renders the weed more grateful afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, undue excitation of any physical function is followed by a
      corresponding depression, on the simple principle that action and reaction
      are equal; and the balance of health turns too easily to be wilfully
      disturbed. Stimulation is a draft upon vital capital, when interest alone
      should suffice: it may be needed at times to bridge a chasm; but habitual
      living beyond vital income infallibly entails bankruptcy in health. The
      use of alcohol in health seems practically restricted to purposes of
      sensuous gratification on the part of those prepared to pay a round price
      for this luxury. The three golden rules here are,—Never drink before
      breakfast; never drink alone; and never drink bad liquor. Their observance
      may make even the abuse of alcohol tolerable. Serious objections, for a
      naturalist at least, are that science, viewed through a glass, seems
      distant and uncertain, while the joys of rum are immediate and
      unquestionable; and that intemperance, being an attempt to defy certain
      physical laws, is therefore eminently unscientific.

      Besides the above good advice by Dr. Coues, the following may prove useful
      to the camper:—<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Diarrhœa may result from overwork and gluttony combined, and from eating
      indigestible or uncooked food, and from imperfect protection of the
      stomach. "Remove the cause, and the effect will cease." A flannel bandage
      six to twelve inches wide, worn around the stomach, is good as a
      preventive and cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same causes may produce cholera morbus; symptoms, violent vomiting and
      purging, faintness, and spasms in the arms and limbs. Unless accompanied
      with cramp (which is not usual), nature will work its own cure. Give warm
      drinks if you have them. Do not get frightened, but keep the patient warm,
      and well protected from a draught of air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The liability to costiveness, and the remedies therefor, are noted on

      A very rare occurrence, but a constant dread with some people, is an
      insect crawling into the ear. If you have oil, spirits of turpentine, or
      alcoholic liquor at hand, fill the ear at once. If you have not these, use
      coffee, tea, warm water (not too hot), or almost any liquid which is not
      hurtful to the skin.

      1st, Treat the patient <i>instantly on the spot</i>, in the
      <i>open air</i>, freely exposing the face, neck, and chest to the breeze,
      except in severe weather.<span class="pagenum"
        ><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      2d, In order <i>to clear the throat</i>, place the patient gently on the
      face, with one wrist under the forehead, that all fluid, and the tongue
      itself, may fall forward, and leave the entrance into the windpipe free.
    </p>
    <p>
      3d, <i>To excite respiration</i>, turn the patient slightly on his side,
      and apply some irritating or stimulating agent to the nostrils, as
      <i>veratrine</i>, <i>dilute ammonia</i>, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      4th, Make the face warm by brisk friction; then dash cold water upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      5th, If not successful, lose no time; but, <i>to imitate respiration</i>,
      place the patient on his face, and turn the body gently but completely
      <i>on the side and a little beyond</i>, then again on the face, and so on
      alternately. Repeat these movements deliberately and perseveringly,
      <i>fifteen times only</i> in a minute. (When the patient lies on the
      thorax, this cavity is <i>compressed</i> by the weight of the body, and
      <i>ex</i>piration takes place. When he is turned on the side, this
      pressure is removed, and <i>in</i>spiration occurs.)
    </p>
    <p>
      6th, When the prone position is resumed, make a uniform and efficient
      pressure <i>along the spine</i>, removing the pressure immediately, before
      rotation on the side. (The pressure augments the <i>ex</i>piration, the
      rotation commences <i>in</i>spiration.) Continue these measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      7th, Rub the limbs <i>upward</i>, with <i>firm pressure</i
      ><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> and with
      <i>energy</i>. (The object being to aid the return of venous blood to the
      heart.)
    </p>
    <p>
      8th, Substitute for the patient's wet clothing, if possible, such other
      covering as can be instantly procured, each bystander supplying a coat or
      cloak, &amp;c. Meantime, and from time to time,
      <i>to excite inspiration</i>, let the surface of the body be
      <i>slapped</i> briskly with the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      9th, Rub the body briskly till it is dry and warm, then dash
      <i>cold</i> water upon it, and repeat the rubbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avoid the immediate removal of the patient, as it involves a
      <i>dangerous loss of time</i>; also the use of bellows or any
      <i>forcing</i> instrument; also the <i>warm bath</i> and
      <i>all rough treatment</i>.
    </p>
    <h3>POISONS.</h3>
    <p>
      In all cases of poisoning, the first step is to evacuate the stomach. This
      should be effected by an emetic which is <i>quickly</i> obtained, and most
      powerful and speedy in its operation. Such are, powdered mustard (a large
      tablespoonful in a tumblerful of warm water), powdered alum (in half-ounce
      doses), sulphate of zinc (ten to thirty grains), tartar emetic (one to two
      grains) combined with powdered ipecacuanha (twenty grains), and sulphate
      of copper (two to five grains). When vomiting has already taken place,
      copious draughts of warm water or warm mucilaginous
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span
      >drinks should be given, to keep up the effect till the poisoning
      substance has been thoroughly evacuated.
    </p>
    <h3>PARTING ADVICE.</h3>
    <p>
      Be independent, but not impudent. See all you can, and make the most of
      your time; "time is money;" and, when you grow older, you may find it even
      more difficult to command time than money.

          A German officer tells me that his comrades in the Franco-Prussian war
          of 1870-1 had no rubber blankets; nor had they any shelter-tents such
          as our Union soldiers used in 1861-5 as a make-shift when their
          rubbers were lost. But this is nothing to you: German discipline
          compelled the soldiers to carry a big cloak which sheds water quite
          well, and is useful to a soldier for other purposes: but the weight
          and bulk condemn it for pleasure-seekers.

          In general it is better to put the shelter-tent in the roll, and to
          keep out the rubber blanket, for you may need the last before you
          camp. You can roll the rubber blanket tightly around the other roll
          (the cloth side out, as the rubber side is too slippery), and thus be
          able to take it off readily without disturbing the other things. You
          can also roll the rubber blanket separately, and link it to the large
          roll after the manner of two links of a chain.

          I knew an officer in the army, who carried a rubber air-pillow through
          thick and thin, esteeming it, after his life and his rations, the
          greatest necessity of his existence. Another officer, when
          transportation was cut down, held to his camp-chair. Almost every one
          has his whim.

          I never heard of a party exclusively of young men going on a tour of
          this kind, and consequently I cannot write their experiences; but I
          can easily imagine their troubles, quarrels, and separation into
          cliques. I once went as captain of a party of ten, composed of ladies,
          gentlemen, and schoolboys. We walked around the White Mountains from
          North Conway to Jefferson and back, by way of Jackson. It cost each of
          us a dollar and thirty-two cents a day for sixteen days, including
          railroad fares to and from Portland, but excluding the cost of
          clothes, tents, and cooking-utensils. Another time a similar party of
          twelve walked from Centre Harbor, N.H., to Bethel, Me., in seventeen
          days, at a daily cost of a dollar and two cents, reckoning as before.
          In both cases, "my right there was none to dispute;" and by borrowing
          a horse the first time, and selling at a loss of only five dollars the
          second, our expenses for the horse were small.

          In one of my tours around the mountains, a lad of sixteen, in
          attempting to hold up the horse's head as they were running down hill,
          was hit by the horse's fore-leg, knocked down, and run over by both
          wheels.

          This advice also differs from that generally given to soldiers; the
          army rule is as follows: "Drink well in the morning before starting,
          and nothing till the halt; keep the mouth shut; chew a straw or leaf,
          or keep the mouth covered with a cloth: all these prevent suffering
          from extreme thirst. Tying a handkerchief well wetted with salt water
          around the neck, allays thirst for a considerable time."—<span

          You cannot find this sort of duck in the market now, but "heavy

          Tents made of heavy drilling were also furnished to the troops, the

          If the party is of four, or even five, a shelter-tent made of three
          breadths of heavy drilling will accommodate all. <i>Sew</i> one
          end-piece to each half-tent, since sewing is better than buttoning,
          and the last is not necessary when your party will always camp
          together. Along the loose border of the end-piece work the
          button-holes, and sew the corresponding buttons upon the main tent an
          inch or more from the edge of the border. Sew on facings at the
          corners and seams as in the army shelter, and also on the middle of
          the bottom of the end-pieces; and put loops of small rope or a foot or
          two of stout cord through all of these facings, for the tent-pins. You
          will then have a tent with the least amount of labor and material in
          it. The top edges, like those of the army shelter, are to have buttons
          and button-holes; the tent can then be taken apart into two pieces,
          each of which will weigh about two pounds and a quarter. Nearly all of
          the work can be done on a sewing-machine; run two rows of stitching at
          each seam as near the selvage as you can.

          Seven-ounce duck is made, but it is not much heavier than drilling,
          and since it is little used it is not easily found for sale. United
          States army wall-tents are made from a superior quality of ten-ounce
          duck, but they are much stouter than is necessary for summer camping.
          There are also "sail-ducks," known as "No. 8," "No. 9," &amp;c., which
          are very much too heavy for tents.

          It is no novelty for women and children to camp out: we see them every
          summer at the seaside and on the blueberry-plains. A great many
          families besides live in rude cabins, which are preferable on many
          accounts, but are expensive. Sickness sometimes results, but usually
          all are much benefited. I know a family that numbered with its guests
          nine ladies, five children ("one at the breast"), and the
          <i>paterfamilias</i>, which camped several weeks through some of the
          best and some of the worst of weather. The whooping-cough broke out
          the second or third day; shortly after, the tent of the mother and
          children blew down in the night, and turned them all out into the
          pelting rain in their night-clothes. Excepting the misery of that
          night and day, nothing serious came of it; and in the fall all
          returned home better every way for having spent their summer in camp.

        Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
        electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
        including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
        because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
        people in all walks of life.
      </div>

      <div style="display: block; margin: 1em 0">
        Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
        assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals
        and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely
        available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and
        permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn
        more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how

        Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
        public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
        number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
        distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of
        equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
        $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with
        the IRS.

      <div style="display: block; margin: 1em 0">
        The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
        charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
        States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
        considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
        with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
        we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
        DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state

      <div style="display: block; margin: 1em 0">
        Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
        concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
        with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
        Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

        Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
        editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
        the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
        necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
